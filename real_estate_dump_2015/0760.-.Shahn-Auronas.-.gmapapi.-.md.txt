Google Maps API Oakland Real Estate map app 


Real Estate-related map to identify potential development lots (lots) in the city of Oakland, CA.
There will be lots added (and deleted once developed) over time to show not only what is 
for sale at the current time but also what is not on the market in order to paint a better 
overall picture of what is happening in the market. 

If your property is listed and for sale on my map, I will share your contact information.
