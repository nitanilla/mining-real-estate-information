<b> "Graffiti BnB" </b>- The democratization of art â€¦

A social networking service aimed at democratizing the commissioning of art. 

"Graffiti BnB" is a social media market place platform that connects street artists with hosts. Street art is generally considered as vandalism and is an illegal activity in most cities around the World. "Graffiti BnB" aims to connect street artists with hosts who are willing to allocate their personal or professional spaces so that artists can legally create pieces on properties and locations without fear of arrest from the police. We believe there is significant value in legally connecting street art and graffiti with real estate space and "Graffiti BnB" seeks to be a first to market pioneer in this space.
