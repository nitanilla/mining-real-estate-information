# property-analysis
Real estate website crawler and analysis

This is a really old perl application that would create a specific set of configured real estate websites, scrape the HTML and parse the code for key feature (property details).
It then executed basic analyis on that data.

This app was the basis for follow-on work in the "landmine" repository.
