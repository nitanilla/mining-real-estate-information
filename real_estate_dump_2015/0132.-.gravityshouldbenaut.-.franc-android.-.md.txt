# Franc for Android
Franc is a money-management application. At the moment, it employs RSS feeds to deliver the latest news and advice as 
to where you should invest. This includes stocks in both the NYSE and NASDAQ stock exchanges, and real estate advice.
The app also allows you to create your own Bitcoin wallet using Coinbase. This helps manage money by
giving you a new way and easy way to save it without filling out lots of paperwork at the bank. More functionalities coming soon!
