The cms today allows the insertion of text and multimedia contents. The license management, geotagging and the application of schemes for the representation of linked data is the prerogative of external plugins. All plugins are to install and study separately.
 #mappiamo is also able to take advantage of the shared data, peer-to-peer networks from other sites and thus produce content in compliance with the Linked Data 5 star suggested by Tim Berners-Lee.

### Features for potential customers
In addition to the individual websites of public houses, small communities or associations up to the bigger organizations are able to benefit from the use of open data and web data (linked data). While the sites of tour operators, real estate portals and smart cities would have every incentive to take advantage of the verified data produced by smaller sites.
Just think about the usefulness of free parking spaces, timetables of public transport, bike sharing and other services offered by the community.
