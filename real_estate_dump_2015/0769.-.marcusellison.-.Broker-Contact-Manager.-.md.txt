Broker-Contact-Manager
======================

Contact Manager for Real Estate Agents and assistants

Bootstrap, Python, Tornado, Mongo

---------------------------------

I created this lightweight project to play around with Tornado and the Trello api.

Bootstrap provided an easy way to get up and running quickly.

As with most of my projects, I like to ground what I'm building to real world solutions to the average person. This project would have leveraged trello as a place to store contacts and move them through a real estate brokers application pipeline.
