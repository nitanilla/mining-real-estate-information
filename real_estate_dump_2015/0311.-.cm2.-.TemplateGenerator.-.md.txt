# Rationale

I originally wrote this tool for my dad because he needed a fast way to make
minor copy changes to boilerplate text for his real estate work. Exciting.

# Usage

The Template Generator is a simple html-based tool that accepts any text with
tokens that look like `{category:token_name}`. They must be stored in a text
file to be read. Anything that doesn't have a section name gets grouped in
general.
