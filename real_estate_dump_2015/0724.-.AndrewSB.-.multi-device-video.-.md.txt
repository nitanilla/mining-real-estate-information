Open source mobile experiment by [Andrew Breckenridge](https://www.twitter.com/Andrew_Breck) and [Han Wang](https://www.twitter.com/wanghan03), May 2014.

Splits a YouTube video into multiple frames that can be played simultaneously on multiple mobile devices, hence giving more screen real estate leading to a larger video to watch.
