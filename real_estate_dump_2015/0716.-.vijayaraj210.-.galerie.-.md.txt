galerie
=======
Decided to chill out and built a local file browser with user experience borrowed from Spotify/Flickr. In my opinion, Nautilus/Dolphin/Explorer waste a lost of screen real-estate. Made Galerie as my default file explorer with rapid regex searches, gif animation, auto-suggest paths, faster opening of all file types with their default applications and better user experience in content browsing.
