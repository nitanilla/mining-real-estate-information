VCHidingTabBarController
========================

UITabBarController is great. But sometimes you stare at the tab bar long enough and it stops making sense.
A black, square...thing, taking up 49 of your precious pixels. Welcome VCHidingTabBarController. 
A UITabBarController replacement with a UITabBar that can be animated off screen for
when you need that screen real estate.
