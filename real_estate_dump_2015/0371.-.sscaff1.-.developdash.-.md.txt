# Develop Dash - A Real Estate Finance Application
This tool is one of the very first that I coded. I am not currently developing the application; however, I've thought of picking it back up at some point. Because it's one of the first applications I coded, it's not up to par with my current abilities. A good deal of the application probably has to be rewritten, but the application does work. I encourage others to contribute if they have time. The application does do income statements, cash flows, net present values, expense additions, revenue streams, and ideally the ability to manage a variety of project. It was meant to be a commercial grade application when I first started coded the application. I took a real estate finance class as part of my MBA that encouraged me to write this application.
