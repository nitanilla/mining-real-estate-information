In this semi-fictionalised version of the BiggerPockets Store, we are selling one of our real estate investing education books and tickets to our conference. We are constantly trying to expand to offer our products to new markets around the world, so we continually need to add support for different payment gateways and methods. Also, as the company grows, we plan to bring new sales and marketing staff on board who will need to see order data in various formats (HTML, XML, etc.). Additionally, we are planning to introduce a lot of new products into the store very soon, such as software and training seminars.
