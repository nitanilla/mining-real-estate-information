Airbrake Notifier Client for PHP
================================
This client is intended to be a drop-in library for communicating with the [Airbrake Notifier API](http://help.airbrake.io/kb/api-2/notifier-api-version-22). [Airbrake](http://airbrake.io/pages/home) is a service that collects errors generated by other applications, and aggregates the results for review.

This client is maintained by [Jonathan Azoff](https://github.com/azoff), under the courtesy of [RentJuice Corp](http://rentjuice.com).

License and Terms
-----------------
This client is freely distributed under the [DBAD License](http://dbad-license.org/license). If you use this software, you agree to the terms governed by the license and you do so __AT YOUR OWN RISK__. RentJuice is not responsible for usage or other concerns with this library. If you have an issue, please feel free to use [the official bug tracker](https://github.com/rentjuice/airbrake-php-client/issues).

Dependencies
------------
In order to communicate with the Airbrake servers, the PHP client depends on a couple dependencies to be installed before running. In no particular order, these dependencies are:

  - [cURL](http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php), to send HTTP requests to Airbrake
  - [SimpleXML](http://us.php.net/manual/en/book.simplexml.php), to validate and parse XML

Getting Started
---------------
To get started, you must first ensure that the aforementioned dependencies are installed. Afterwards, you may run the [provided example](https://github.com/rentjuice/airbrake-php-client/blob/master/example.php) to verify that the dependencies are met and that your Airbrake account is set up correctly. In order to run the example, you will need to provide your API key; I found mine on the project dashboard:

![Project Dashboard](http://f.cl.ly/items/0M0b3I0r092j2B2A3X1d/Screen%20shot%202012-01-18%20at%204.15.12%20PM.png)

If you are looking to jump right into things and reading code isn't your thing, here is the quick and dirty version:

```php
# load the client
require('/airbrake.notifier.php');

# instantiate the notifier
$notifier = new AirbrakeNotifier($_YOUR_API_KEY);

# catch an error
try {

    # assuming you have an error...
    doSomethingBad();

} catch(Exception $e) {
    
    # track the error, and get back the Airrake ID for the notice
    $noticeId = $notifier->notifyException($e);

    # you can also be explicit...
    $trace = AirbrakeNotifier::getFixedTrace($e->getTrace());
    $noticeId = $notifier->notify('Something bad happened!', 'SomeExplicitError', $trace, array(
        'some_info' => 'both functions take an optional final parameter',
        'more_info' => 'which can be used to add extra information to the notice!',
        'note' => 'you can find this EXTRA_DATA of the params on Airbrake'
    ));

}
```

Special Thanks
--------------
This client would not be available if it weren't for the kind graces of the development team at [RentJuice](http://rentjuice.com).
RentJuice uses this client internally, and allocated time to open-source it for the good of error loggin' devs everywhere.
If you are a broker, landlord or anyone who deals with residential real estate, consider checking them out as suitable "thanks"
for using this plugin.
