So You Think You Can Dance...ON MY GRAVE?
-----------------------------------------

Kanzepharaz of the one thousand and eight spires.  Kanzepharaz capital of the 
Empire of K'thorv and since the succesful end to the war that led to the 
annihilation of the Pleiadic Oligarchy in K'threl, the richest and most 
splendid city in the Middle World.  Kanzepheraz whose real estate prices have 
soared e'en beyond the calculation of the rainbow abacus of Thobis Himself.

Anathomelis, a princeling of the Imperial Clan needs a location for his new 
and expanded orgy dome.  Yet the only available--and affordable on a seventh 
rank civil allowance--place left in the city of one thousand and eight spires 
is the tomb of Pharaz the First and Subsequent, lich-emperor of the Jerelite 
dynasty and his necromantic retainers.  Before the construction-serfs can move 
in, the tomb must be cleared of its unshriven and non-rent-paying denizens.

As His Principalities' chief swordbearer it has fallen to you to make the tomb
of Pharaz safe for gentrification.  Treasures and honors await you if you 
succeed.  Aeons of torment in the Planes of Unlife await you if you fail.

WILL YOU RISE TO THE CHALLENGE?
