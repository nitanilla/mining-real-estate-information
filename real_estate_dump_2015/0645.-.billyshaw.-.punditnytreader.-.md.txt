<h3>Project Description</h3>
Pundit NYT Newster is a Chrome extension app that replaces new tab page with the top news stories from The New York Times.

The goal is to make a news dashboard that is easy to access (a browser new tab page is the
most accessible page on the web) and visually compelling. 

The app was developed as a class project at NYU Courant Institute, when I realized that:   
1) Chrome Browser is a fascinating, powerful OS that has a ton of potential   
2) The New Tab page is the most under-utilized real estate on the internet.

The news stories will refresh every hour and be obtained from:  
1. The New York Times API (default): most emailed, shared, viewed stories of the day
