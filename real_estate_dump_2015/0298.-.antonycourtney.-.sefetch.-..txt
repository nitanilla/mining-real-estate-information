Tribeca Citizen / StreetEasy Fetch using Play

This is a web service for automatically generating the "Recent Real Estate Sales in Tribeca" weekly post in Tribeca Citizen, built atop the Play web framework.

The guts of the code to pull the relevant info from streeteasy and parse it are in the 'tclib' sub-project.
The rest of the code here exposes that functionality as a very simple web service using Play.
