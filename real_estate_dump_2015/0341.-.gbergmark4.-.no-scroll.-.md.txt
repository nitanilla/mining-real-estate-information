no-scroll
=========

fiddling around with a web UI that doesn't allow scrolling.

After reading a few articles about the decline of deep reading, I'd started to think about what might enable deep reading on electronic devices. 

I feel that scrolling demands reading be skimmed. If scrolling could be replaced with a fast, intuitive, comfortable way to display text in the screen real estate the user provides, this would surely improve readability.
