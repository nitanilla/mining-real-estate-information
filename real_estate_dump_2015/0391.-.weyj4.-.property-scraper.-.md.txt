# property-scraper
Scrape a real estate website for a geography thesis. In progress.

Working on 2 different scripts, one in Python and the other in Ruby. Probably ultimately going to use the Ruby script.

TO-DO:
 make it possible to use dr.click with PhantomJS, not just Firefox;
 fix the "comp" function
