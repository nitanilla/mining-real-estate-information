# Hello-World

My name is Zak Dietzen. I am a 25 year old real estate inverstor from Fort Fauderdale. Excited to be here in San Diego learning code! I have always had an intrest in computers so why not take my passion a little further.  

Can't wait to meet everyone in the Origin class! Lets make history.
