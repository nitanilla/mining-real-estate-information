# project-sandbox

Project Sandbox is a pilot program that helps us reimagine the relationship between a civic tech community and its local government by putting open data platforms at the core of how work gets done.

We will use maps and [GitHub](http://github.com) to better understand how the City can use the properties it owns to drive economic development - specifically as this ties to Business Improvement Districts, City Council Districts, surplus land, and other areas we might find interesting. See definitions of these and other terms below.

MaptimeLA and the city will hold a series of workshops to teach the public how to use government data to create maps and answer questions.

The outcomes and lessons learned from this unusual collaboration will be shared for others to build off from.

=======

## our goals:
- **Document and Open Data**: keep a log of the steps, questions, decisions, and key milestones or discoveries that make this type of partnership work for all involved.
- **Map**: map publicly-owned vacant properties owned by the City of Los Angeles
- **Explore**: explore possible uses of this land, specifically: (1) Business Improvement Districts, (2) City Council Districts, (3) surplus land and other areas.
- **Workshops**: Hold a series of workshops with Maptime
- **Retrospective Lessons**: share our lessons with likeminded people
