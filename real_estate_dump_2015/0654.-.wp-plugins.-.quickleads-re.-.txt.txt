QuickLeads RE let's you quickly get leads from your website.

== Description ==

People shopping for real estate on the internet email and call you AND your competition until they get hold of someone. People shopping for real estate on the internet want to talk to someone NOW! The first agent to respond to the inquiry almost always "wins" the business. 

QuickLeads RE shoots leads to you via text message within seconds, giving you a huge advantage over your competition. 

Real estate teams and small brokerages use QuickLeads RE to send incoming leads to multiple agents within the team or brokerage at the same time creating competition for leads and resulting in extremely fast response times. 

Management can see all incoming leads on one simple web page and monitor response times and lead to closing conversion. QuickLeads RE uses Twitter to handle text message distribution and lead monitoring for a very stable, reliable and easy to use system.

== Installation ==

Step 1: Make sure you are using WordPress Version 3.1 or higher. 

Step 2: Install the plugin and watch the video tutorials provided.

After you install the plugin be sure to hover over the "Settings"" button within the navigation bar of your WordPress Admin Panel. The "Settings" button looks like a little square box with two sliding buttons in it. When you hover over the "Settings" button a drop down menu will open and then click on QuickLeads RE. Another window will open and in there you will find video tutorials that explain every feature of QuickLeads RE and how to set it up.

VERY IMPORTANT

You MUST complete ALL QuickLeads RE fields within the "Settings" section or else QuickLeads RE will NOT appear on your blog. You will not see this noted in the tutorials.

ALSO after completing the setup in the "Settings" section you MUST go to the "Appearance" page of WordPress. Hover over the Appearance button on the WordPress navigation bar (the button is square and looks like a tiny screen shot of a blog page), as you hover over the button a dropdown menu will open. Click on "Widgets." Find the QuickLeads RE widget and drag and drop it into the sidebar of your blog. You will not see this noted in the tutorials.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this free? =

Yes. All we ask is that you don't alter the code in any way so that it works properly and we get a little recognition. :-)

= Is it easy to install? =

Yes. We have created video tutorials which walk you through the entire process. You will find the tutorials under the Installation tab. 

= Is it easy to uninstall? =

Yes. Simply click on the "plugins" navigation button in your WordPress Admin panel, find QuickLeads RE in the list of plugins that you have already installed, check the box and click "delete." That's it.

= Does QuickLeads RE post advertisements on my site? =

Nope. QuickLeads RE does have a small unobtrusive reference to who we are but it is not an advertisement and we do not make money from it. 

= How does QuickLeads RE work? =

Basically when someone visits your blog and wants to reach you they fill out a very simple "request for information" card. The contact info that they provide plus their message is instantly sent to a private Twitter Page that you will set up exclusively for such contacts. Twitter then text messages you the information. The whole process usually takes 5-10 seconds. 

= Will other people be able to see my lead information on Twitter? =

Nope. We have you set up a private Twitter page for your eyes only. This way only you can see the contact information from your leads. 

= Can QuickLeads RE handle a high volume of leads? = 

We've been using a variation of QuickLeads RE on my own web site since 2009 during which time we have received an average of 40 leads per week with a high of about 80. 

= Does QuickLeads RE generate leads for me? =

No. You have to create your own leads by writing good relevant content in your blog. But QuickLeads RE will allow people to reach you fast once they decide to contact you. And remember in the world of sales, the first real estate agent to respond usually gets the deal. 

= Is QuickLeads RE exclusively for real estate agents? =

No I am a real estate agent and I know how great QuickLeads RE is for my business but frankly I don't care who uses it.

= Do you offer customer support? =

Since this is a free service we don't have a technical support department. If you need help, please take a hard look at the video tutorials. If you still need help then email me at "QuickLeadsRE at willdaly dot com" (sorry have to write it this way so spammers don't pick up my email address).
