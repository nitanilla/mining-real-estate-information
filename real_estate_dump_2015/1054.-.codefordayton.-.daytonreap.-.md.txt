## Installation

Dayton REAP uses [npm](http://howtonode.org/introduction-to-npm) and [bower](http://bower.io/#install-bower). Follow those links to get the prerequisites installed before starting.

Once the toolchain is installed, simply run:
```
git clone https://github.com/codefordayton/daytonreap.git
cd daytonreap
npm install
bower install
npm run start
```

Running `npm run start` will start a server, and should open a browser window at http://localhost:8000/.
