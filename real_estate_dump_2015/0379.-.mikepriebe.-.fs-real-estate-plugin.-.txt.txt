This professional real estate plugin gives you the ability to add real estate listings to your WordPress website.

== Description ==

<strong>Please note, custom filters, listing sorting and comparing are now only available on the Professional Version <a href="http://www.firestormplugins.com/extensions/real-estate/">available for purchase on our website</a>.</strong>

The FireStorm Real Estate Plugin is an advanced real estate plugin allowing you to turn your WordPress website or blog into a fully functional real estate listing website. The plugin is ideal for Realtors, Agents, Brokers, For Sale By Owner listings and Real Estate Agencies looking to list properties. The administration is easy to use and loaded with features. The front end is great for SEO. It operates stand-alone which means it does not require blog posts for each property listing. This allows you to keep your blog separate from the real estate listings. Filters and short codes allow you to add single and multiple listings to any page or post.
