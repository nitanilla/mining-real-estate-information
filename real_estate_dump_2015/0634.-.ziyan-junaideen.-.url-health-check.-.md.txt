### Story

Been involved in Real Estate, having to wrok with websites build with no API for easy manipulation, I some times have to manually visit URLs and to check if they exist. After few days of painful and wasteful attempts I started URL Health Check that will help seperate URLs on the HTTP response, for ex: HTTP-404.


### Instructions

1. Clone - `git clone git@github.com:ziyan-junaideen/url-health-check.git`
2. Checkout Develop branch - `git checkout develop`
3. Run Rails in webrick - `rails s -p 10100` 

### Tests

This project was not planned at all and by the time it was first launched, the structure of the app significantly changed. Once I get a stable structure, which I think is now, I would start writing tests. Ah yes, I need to read the RSpec book too.
