a Real Estate Transaction Standard (RETS) library written for go

Yeah, there isn't any documentation yet and most likely won't be any until someone shows interest. Sorry, thats the way it works! But, if you are like me and completely fed up with under-performing libraries written in some scripting languages (ruby's rets gem, I'm looking at you), give this a look and IMPROVE it. God knows, this is not a good body of code here and I didn't have the time or inclination to be compeletly RETS 1.7.2 standards compliant, but I know that YOU do! Yay! I can't wait to see what you do with it.
