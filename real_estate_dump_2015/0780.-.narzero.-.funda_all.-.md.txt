# Funda Magic Rocket

[Funda Magic](https://github.com/narzero/funda_magic) is used to scrape all
real estate data from [Funda](http://www.funda.nl).

Twice a day, a rake task is run to fetch all real estate properties on
Funda. First it checks if the property is present in the database, if it's
not present it will be added.

All data is saved to a [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) database.

## Note

This is a work in progress.
