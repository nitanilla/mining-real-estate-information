IDX-Github
==========

Collection of IDX Functions

These are functions I use to create real estate websites in Oregon using a RETS feed from
RMLS.  This is mostly for my own archival purposes, but if you have a MySQL database
created from a RETS feed in your area, they would probably be fairly easy to modify
and use.

Names are pretty self-explanatory and there is some basic documentation in each file.
