Mailchimp is one of the most used and most feature-rich Email Marketing system and has a very generous 'Freemium' business model
It's extensive API makes it easy to integrate it with your own web applications. 
We at Pauli Systems integrated it with User registration, Membership administration and Real-Estate Listing application. 
This repository holds the Coldfusion cfc we used to connect with Mailchimp API. Feel free to use and fork.

Note: We are in the process of moving communcation about this code from riaforge.org to Github.com, that's why this space is still empty.
Stay tuned.
