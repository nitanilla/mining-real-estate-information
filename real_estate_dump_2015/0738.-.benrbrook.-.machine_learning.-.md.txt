This repo contains most of the work I have been doing in machine learning research with Dr. Scott Sanner.

A Google Maps Geocoding API key is requried to use the geo scripts.  Just place the key in a file called key.txt.

"location-data" contains all of the formatted geospatial data.  The includes real estate, weather, and USGS well data.
