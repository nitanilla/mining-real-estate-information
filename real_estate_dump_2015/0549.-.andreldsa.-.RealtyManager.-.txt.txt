The Context

The software to be developed will provide an environment to a generic Real Estate Agency, giving to administrator the capacity to follow-up the sales during the period of transaction between the seller and the client. The administrator will be able to register clients, real estate properties, real estate agents (users) and manage sales during a period of time. In that period it’s possible change the state of the sale (transaction between the seller and the client, in this case), following the pre-defined states (sold, preparing documents,  awaiting approval,  awaiting payment, closed). The sale is the main model of the software, linked with one client, one real estate property and one real estate agent. Furthermore, has the date that property was sold, the price and agent’s commission.
This specification it’s a solution to a real problem of a specific Real Estate Agency in Brazil, called “Atual Imóveis”.
