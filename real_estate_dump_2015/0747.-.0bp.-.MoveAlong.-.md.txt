MoveAlong
=========

You like watching movies while working on a laptop but the video hides most of 
your screen real estate?

MoveAlong will position the player window around the four corners of your screen 
in clockwise direction if your mouse gets over the player. Now you can access all
applications without manually dragging the video player around.

In order to work the video window has to be smaller (or equal) than 1/4 of your 
screen size. 

MoveAlong sits in your menubar, where you can easily select a window of a video.
