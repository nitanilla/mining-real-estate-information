# Flipulator

The Flipulator is a tool designed to help a real estate investor evaluate the viability of purchasing a property
for the express purpose of rehabbing (repairing) and then resell the property at a profit.

The Flipulator supports two rehab options, flat rate and rehab class.

The basic finance (home purchase) mode is supported in Flipulator at this time with two other modes (owner carry rehab 
cost and purchase/rehab) to be added in a follow-on build.
