Data Extraction Tools â€“ Champions Capital Inc
===============

Project Summary
===============
Champions Capital Inc offered me a co-op during the summer of 2008 to help them do internet research and assist them with database handling.

Technologies Used
===============
Java, or JDBC to be specific, was the tool I used in extracting information from the internet as well as inserting into the SQL database. Shell/Bash scripting was the means of repeatedly calling the Java classes so that large amounts of information can be inserted into the database quickly.

Responsibilities/Roles
===============
I was responsible for the following tasks:
-Report to the project manager and boss about status of my project weekly.
-Generate reports based on different car dealerships, population of cities, real estate areas, etc.
-Create an extraction tool using JDBC and extract information from sites such as http://www.apartment.com and http://www.ford.com
-Upload relevant information such as dealership models, real estate contact information, etc to the database.
-Google SEO the main site (http://www.acerenting.com).
