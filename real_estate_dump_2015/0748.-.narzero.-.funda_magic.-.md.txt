# Funda Magic

A little bit of Ruby magic is used to scrape all real estate data from [Funda](http://www.funda.nl).

Sharing is caring.

## Usage

**Step 1: Install the Mechanize gem**

```
gem install mechanize
```

**Step 2: Clone this repository**

```
git clone https://github.com/narzero/funda_magic.git
```

**Step 3: Run magic.rb**

```
ruby magic.rb
```

**Step 4: Get some coffee**

In about 1 hour, you'll have a single JSON file containing all
real estate data from Funda.

## Limitations

Currently limited to the city of Rotterdam. Will change in the future.
