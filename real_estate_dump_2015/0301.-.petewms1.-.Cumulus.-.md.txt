# Cumulus

This is the first take at a deployment for Hoss.

Based (so far) on the Fat Free CRM package (http://www.fatfreecrm.com/)

This package is an excellent starting point, as it is already a full-featured CRM
system, and has much of the underlying "lead" functionality thought-out and
incorporated.  We will be extending this to include the building and space
information.
