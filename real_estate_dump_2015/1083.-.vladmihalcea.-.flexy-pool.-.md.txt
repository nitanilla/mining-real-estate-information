### Introduction

The FlexyPool library adds metrics and flexible strategies to a given Connection Pool, allowing it to resize on demand.
This is very handy since most connection pools offer a limited set of dynamic configuration strategies.

### Who uses FlexyPool

<a href="http://www.etuovi.com/"><img src="http://avain.etuovi.com/media/layout/images/etuovi-logo.gif"/></a> is the leading real estate portal in Finland.

> New Etuovi.com has used FlexyPool in production since early 2014. 
> The library has proven to be reliable and allows our infrastructure to handle temporary spikes much better. 
> We use it everywhere in our stack, ranging from our frontends to the backend services.
