# Web Standards Project

#### This site is hosted <a href="http://www.hausofalexander.ml/UniversitySites/WSP/" target="_blank">over at Haus of Alexander</a>.

This course examines students' development abilities by asking them to create a site over the course of the month. Students were given a choice of a site to create and I've chosen to create a prototype for real estate search and listing. The site allows anyone to list and search real estate listings within its' database. Listings are created by scheduling a meet-up with a member of the company in order to verify details of the property to be listed are as accurate as possible.

I'd also like to mention that I'm hosting it at my site because GitHub Pages doesn't support the use of PHP for obvious reasons and because I'd like as many of my sites to be on my server as possible. I don't know why I felt the need to tell you, but if you didn't know, now you know!
