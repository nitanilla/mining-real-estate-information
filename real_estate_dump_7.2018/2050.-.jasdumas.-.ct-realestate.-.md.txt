## About the data

The Office of Policy and Management in Connecticut maintains a listing of all real estate sales with a sales price of $2,000 or greater that occur between October 1 and September 30 of each year. For each sale record, the file includes: town, property address, date of sale, property type (residential, apartment, commercial, industrial or vacant land), sales price, and property assessment.
