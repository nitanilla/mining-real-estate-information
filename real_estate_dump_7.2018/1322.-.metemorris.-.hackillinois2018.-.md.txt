# Walkable 
An open source & crowd sourced walking navigation for safe, fast & resourceful walks around your place.

Uses completely anonymous location & reporting data from people around the town & machine learning to suggest safe, fast and enjoyable trips around town.
Reports and visualizes insights from user data to public safety to improve security in towns

Front-End of the application was built using react-native, react-native-maps, google maps API.
Back-end was made using phython flask. 

## Uses

### For Civillian
- Find safe routes to your destination.
- Find out details about routes you walk.
- A heatmap to avoid over crowded areas or find popular areas.
- Find events and activities near your walking routes, join if you are adventurous or avoid if you don't want to be bothered

### For Public Safety
- Analyze popular routes by users and ensure high security by focusing on those areas
- Identify and analyze security concerns in crowded areas
- Get rich insights from crowd sourced data over the cloud using our dashboard
- Give and receive general community feedback on paths that people take every day

## Open Sourcing the platform
We strongly believe that this tool needs to be open sourced in order to maintain transparency, credibility and allow government and city officials to maintain their own version of the database and data analytics to empower their communities and economic development. 

Prizes
============
## Information overload - Accessing the worldâ€™s information and making it readily accessible to everyone. 

We are crowdsourcing the pathways of walking to make walking around the town a better and a more feasible journey. We help users report incidents such as food shelters, or potholes - helping the users nearby know whether they should take a particular path or not. This is readily available to everyone through the power of open source, including government 

## Hardcore software - Tool that expand upon current Microsoft tech 

We used Microsoft BI to analyze results of our findings regarding the walking patterns and incidents

## Fund your dreamscape

Walkable implements react-native and uses react-native-maps in the frontend. To further extend upon react-native-maps, we implemented a heat map for hot locations where users walked. This feature can be further extended to include different colors for heat maps, etc. 

## Walking your dog food to Market 

Walkable has commercial viability in the sense that the data collected can be used by people ranging from government officials trying to find the locations with most reported incidents to real estate developers trying to find out the most walked location in a vicinity. 

## Hacking socio-technical challenge in our community

Walkable creates a dataset for walking patterns and incident reports in a particular town or vicinity. The data collected in the app can be used to extend the current data available to the extending municipal data to the City of Champaign.

How to run the backend
============

The backend is implemented in Python Flask and contains the rest endpoints for the front end to access. The backend is deployed on Heroku. 

Instructions
------------

First, you'll need to clone the repo.

    $ git clone https://github.com/metemorris/hackillinois2018.git

Second, let's download `pip`, `virtualenv`, `foreman`, and the [`heroku`
Ruby gem](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-the-cli).

    $ sudo easy_install pip
    $ sudo pip install virtualenv
    $ sudo gem install foreman heroku

Now, you can setup an isolated environment with `virtualenv`.

    $ virtualenv --no-site-packages env
    $ source env/bin/activate


Installing Packages
--------------------

### Gevent

To use `gevent`, we'll need to install `libevent` for the
`gevent` production server. If you're operating on a Linux OS, you can
`apt-get install libevent-dev`. If you're using Mac OS X, consider
installing the [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) package
manager, and run the following command:

    $ brew install libevent

If you're using Mac OS X, you can also install `libevent` through [a DMG
available on Rudix](http://rudix.org/packages-jkl.html#libevent).


### Without Gevent

If you'd rather use `gunicorn` without `gevent`, you just need to edit
the `Procfile` and `requirements.txt`.

First, edit the `Procfile` to look the following:

    web: gunicorn -w 4 -b "0.0.0.0:$PORT" app:app

Second, remove `gevent` from the `requirements.txt` file.

### pip

Then, let's get the requirements installed in your isolated test
environment.

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt


Running Your Application
------------------------

Now, you can run the application locally.

    $ foreman start

You can also specify what port you'd prefer to use.

    $ foreman start -p 5555


Deploying to Heroku
---------

    $ git push heroku master
    $ heroku scale web=1

Finally, we can make sure the application is up and running.

    $ heroku ps

Now, we can view the application in our web browser.

    $ heroku open

And, to deactivate `virtualenv` (once you've finished coding), you
simply run the following command:

    $ deactivate


Rest endpoints
----------

After you've got your application up and running, there a couple next
steps you should consider following

### /update/ 

POST request

It takes in: 
- latitude (required)
- longitude (required)
- user id (required)

This updates the user's location in the SQL database and also on firebase for real time updates. 

### /updateIncidents/ 

POST request

It takes in: 
- latitude (required)
- longitude (required)
- type (required)

This updates the incident's location, along with the type in the SQL database and also on firebase for real time updates. 

### /get/heatmap/ 

POST request

It takes in: 
- latitude (required)
- longitude (required)

This gives the heatmap near the location.


### /get/traffic/ 

POST request

It takes in: 
- latitude (required)
- longitude (required)

This gives the traffic around a certain location.

### /get/incident/ 

POST request

It takes in: 
- latitude (required)
- longitude (required)

This gives the incident around a certain location.


Testing | Simulating users
----------
To simulate users, you can run simulation.py. 

Simulation.py contains the range of latitude/longitude you want your 'users' to be simulated within. You can also specify how much distance the users should move, and also specify the duration in which they will trigger an incident. Along with the amount of users that can be simulated, even the randomness of an incident generation can be adjusted.
