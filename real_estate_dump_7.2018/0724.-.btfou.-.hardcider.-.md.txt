####[View Demo](http://btfou.github.io/hardcider/)

Demo currently running: [v0.3.2](https://github.com/btfou/hardcider/releases/tag/v0.3.2)

####Getting Started

Simply fork or download this repo.

Basic map parameters and layers to load can be configured in `viewer/js/settings.js`.

Beyond that, knowledge of JavaScript, Dojo and the ESRI JavaScript API are required.

Questions, comments and issues are welcome [here](https://github.com/btfou/hardcider/issues).

####Notes

* Hard Cider's intended use is an internal viewer for organizations with ArcGIS Server, and for deploying custom tasks and functionalities therein. If you are looking for a viewer for the web, with better documentation and support, check out David Spriggs' [ConfigurableViewerJSAPI](https://github.com/DavidSpriggs/ConfigurableViewerJSAPI).
* Hard Cider is mobile and touch friendly, but is primarily a desktop application. Not the best for small screens. Not yet thoroughly tested on touch devices. The map's right-click menu can be accessed on touch devices with a long press.
* Hard Cider uses Dojo's claro theme with a few css tweaks to improve/simplify the look and maximize screen real estate for the map. Its beauty is derived from its simplicity and functionality.
* I am not very good about commenting. I'm working on it.
