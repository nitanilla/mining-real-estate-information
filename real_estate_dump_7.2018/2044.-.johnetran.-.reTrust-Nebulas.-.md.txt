In real estate and other domains, an agreement is a meeting of minds, where a buyer agrees to purchase property from a seller by committing a deposit. In many jurisdictions, a trusted common organization such as a real estate brokerage or law office holds the deposit "in trust" for the buyer, until the parties either fulfill the agreement, or mutually release each other from it.

When a common organization is lacking or untrusted to hold deposits, a blockchain can fill this role. Unlike in the traditional real estate transaction where only the buyer submits a deposit, we believe the seller should also submit a deposit, to ensure both parties have collateral in the agreement.
