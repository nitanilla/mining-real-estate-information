## MMM-SORT

**S**tatic **O**r **R**otating **T**ides

## S.O.P.

As usual, this module was not made to compete with any others. I make simple modules
because I enjoy doing it. I try to keep them small so that they don't use too much
screen real estate. My hope is that they are all informative, or fun, or both.

## What you get

**S**tatic**

* A static display of the next 8 tides
* High/Low tide icon indicator, day and time of tide
* Your own text to indicate high or low tides (config option)
* Day, date and time dim when the most recent tide passes
* Name of the location of the tide station (If desired)
* Tide station used is the closest to your longitude and latitude

## Or

**R**otating

* A rotation of tides for the next 7 days
* Day, date and time for each tide
* High tide or Low tide with icon indicator
* Height variance of tide in feet or meters (config option)
* Name of the location of the tide station (If desired)
* Tide station used is the closest to your longitude and latitude
* The actual longitude and latitude of tide station being used (If desired)

## Examples

Annotated .css file included for position, sizing, and coloring. Default is white.

* Static. Color it any way you like. Don't want the location? It's gone!

* Rotating. One colored with header, one plain white with no header.
