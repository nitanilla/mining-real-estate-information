# Customer-Behaviour

This file analyses the dataset of customer behviour and their behavioural differences, i.e., between investors and non-investors, in
a real estate company

The dataset was sent by Property Partner company in London in Thu 15/12/2016, where they made a short test for a 
junior data scientist role at their company.

Their question was:
--------------------
We have attached a small subset of data from our front end events database. Dataset focuses on behavioural activity before 
user makes their first investment. Each of the lines is a distinct user's behaviour before making the first investment. 
You will note that not everyone from this dataset made the first investment. What we would like you to do is to analyse 
the data and look for the behavioural differences between investors and non-investors.
