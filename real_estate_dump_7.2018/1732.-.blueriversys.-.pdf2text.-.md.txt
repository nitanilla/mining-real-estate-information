Java example on how to extract text from PDF using both Tika and PDFBox

## How to use it
Clone it and either load into your favorite IDE or use maven directly.
After that, you can either provide a PDF file or a URL of a PDF as input. Take a look at the unit test which shows the latter approach.

To use this application with any other real estate PDF url, follow the procedure below.

## Examples of PDF from the Web
This application was created to read publicly available specific real estate PDFs containing properties sold in a given year in the state of Massachussetts, data provided by the [Middlesex North Registry of Deeds](http://www.lowelldeeds.com/sales.htm).

1. Choose a town and year for which you want to see properties sold.
2. Your browser will open that PDF automatically
3. Copy and paste the link into PdfExtractorMain class.

Enjoy!
