counsel
=====

counsel gives you real-time insights on who is visiting your web properties by notifying your phone whenever you get a visit.

How it works:

1. Create a tracking pixel in counsel
2. Embed your tracking pixel in your estate (a web property e.g. your personal website).
2. Install the mobile app
3. Receive push notifications whenever people visit your estate!
