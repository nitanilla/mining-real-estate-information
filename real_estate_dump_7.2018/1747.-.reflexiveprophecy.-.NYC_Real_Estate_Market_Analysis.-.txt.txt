As a previous real estate consultant, I've found that often, the existing real estate data providers don't break down property classes in each neighborhood in New York City. And to do so, one would require a large amount of data with an efficient tool that can handle the amount of data; excel often falls short when the size of the data gets bigger. This project is designed to achieve this task by visualizing and charting the sale transactions in New York City, categorized by properties and neighborhoods, using R and Shiny.
