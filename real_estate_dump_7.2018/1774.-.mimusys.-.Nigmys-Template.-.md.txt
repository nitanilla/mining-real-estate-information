Year Long Capstone project during senior year of Undergrad at Arizona State University. The client, also a student 
at Arizona State University, had started to build a website for his real estate portfolio management company. The website allows users
with real estate investments manage their portfolio, along with giving the users a breakdown (in terms of charts and figures) on how their
investments are doing. It would also compile an executable excel document for reference.

My team of 6 was mainly involved in building the front of end of the website using the Bootstrap framework along with JavaScript. 
We worked on the User Login Page, Property Investments Page, Balance Sheets, and Income Statements page.
