### An overview of the Chicago Startup Ecosystem

A few weeks ago, I moved to Chicago to join the investment team at [Lightbank](http://lightbank.com). Although our fund invests nationwide (and sometimes internationally), I’ve been spending my first few weeks doing a dive into Chicago's startup ecosystem in order to get a better sense of my new home.

Chicago’s tech startup scene has grown a lot over the last four years. As a student at the University of Illinois I did trips up to Chicago a few times each semester to work out of coworking spaces or meet with founders. It has been amazing to see the growth in the last few years and I’m excited to become a part of the ecosystem.

As with many of my other posts, this is meant to be dynamic. If I’ve missed anything, let me know through twitter or email (ali@afridi.io) and I’ll update it. I’ve also published this on github, so feel free to update and make a pull request to the repo. *For those on github, this is published [on Medium](https://medium.com/@AliKAfridi/an-overview-of-chicagos-tech-ecosystem-43d9fc8a7f4e#.yi8lzpt4f) as well*
