Easily import property listings from any XML or CSV file to the Real Places theme with the Real Places Add-On for WP All Import.

== Description ==

The Real Places Add-On for [WP All Import](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-all-import "WordPress XML & CSV Import") makes it easy to bulk import your property listings to the Real Places theme in less than 10 minutes.

The left side shows all of the fields that you can import to and the right side displays a property listing from your XML/CSV file. Then you can simply drag & drop the data from your XML or CSV into the Real Places fields to import it.

The importer is so intuitive it is almost like manually adding a property listing in Real Places.

We have several other real estate add-ons available, each specific to a different theme. This is a walkthrough of the Realia Add-On, which is very similar to the Real Places Add-On.
