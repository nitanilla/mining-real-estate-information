Here I am scraping data from Real Estate and comparing it with Airbnb Data!

This project will compare listing I obtained from [Airbnb open Data Collection](http://tomslee.net/airbnb-data-collection-get-the-data) with the scraped Real Estate Data from the website [casaclick.it](http://www.casaclick.it/). I will focus on three cities from Italy (Florence, Turin and Venice) and use Selector Gadget (a chrome extension) on the website to scrape the Real Estate Listing by neighborhoods.

The end goal for this project is to answer to the question: “If I were to buy a house in a certain neighborhood within the three cities, which one will have a higher return on investement (ROI)? (In other words, which one, if rented out with Airbnb, which neighborhood will give me back more quickly the amount of money I spent on buying the house?)”.

We will scrape the first page of each neighborhoods for each city, then we will compare the neiborhoods with the Areas given in the Airbnb Data and answer to the question.
