# Stamp duty calculator for real estate in AUS

This mobile application is a calculator for estimating stamp duty due on Australian real estate. Each state in Australia calculates its stamp duty differently and therefore requires different questions and calculations. No internet connection is required to operate the application, but if internet access is available, your geolocation is geocoded (via google) to pre-set the State or Territory you reside in.

## Motivation

This code is an educational project for learning the hybrid mobile framework [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com) and the modern JS framework [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org). It was originally written by [Alex Bergin](http://alexbergin.com) in the summer of 2014/15.

Any feedback on the code, concepts or ideas, are very much welcome  - either open an [issue on github.com](https://github.com/alexkb/sdc/issues), [fork/merge request](https://github.com/alexkb/sdc/fork) or [tweet me on @alexkbergin](https://twitter.com/alexbergin).
