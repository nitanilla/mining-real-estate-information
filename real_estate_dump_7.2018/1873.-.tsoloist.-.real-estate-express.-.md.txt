# Real Estate Website

## What it Is
This is a website for a real estate agent who specializes in investor interests. She requested a site that would allow her investor clients to log in to see unlisted investment properties. On the front end, users can register for access to the list of exclusive properties or submit a contact form for general questions. On the backend, the agent can add unlisted properties to the site, which will eventually display to the registered user. She can also designate which properties to feature on the home page.
