Import listings into Easy Property Listings with this WP All Import add-on for WordPress. Created for maximum performance.

== Description ==

Import listings into [Easy Property Listings](https://easypropertylistings.com.au/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=description_tab&utm_content=description&utm_campaign=wordpressorg_import) with this advanced WP All Import add-on with ease and faster than ever. This plugin has over 150 custom fields pre-configured for you and supports XML, CSV, XLS files and you can fully automate importsÂ with <a href="http://www.wpallimport.com/">WP All Import Pro</a> server cron jobs.

Our goal with this add-on is not to just be able to import listings into Easy Property Listings but to improve import speed especially with images.

Supported formats are CSV, XML and XLS files with full support for the Australian REAXML format when using the [FeedSync Pre-Processor](https://easypropertylistings.com.au/extensions/feedsync/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=description_tab&utm_content=feedsync&utm_campaign=wordpressorg_import_feedsync) and Jupix UK formats. We have implemented an image and date/time skipping to minimise image imports so they are only updated when changed. We are seeing a 78% speed improvement using this plugin.

* Requires Easy Property Listings 2.3 or newer.
* Requires WP All Import.
