PropertyWebBuilder is a website builder for the real estate sector.  It can be adapted for use as a CRM, property listings site, vacation rentals listing site etc.

This project provides an admin panel that uses the API endpoints provided by PropertyWebBuilder to manage the look and feel, property listings, agency details etc.

Please note that as of February 2018 this project is in the process of being replaced by an implementation using Vue js.  The new repo for that is here:
