### Introduction

:moneybag: The portly man with the bulging coin purse approaches with his two strong, but inexperienced-looking bodyguards. Without so much as extending his hand, he speaks:

> So ye think ye want to be an adventurer, eh?

After scanning you over, he continues:
> Certainly don't look the type, all sissified and soft. Ye'll be running for yer wetnurse soon enough, I'll warrant. But if ye want to play with the big boys, ye've come to the right place. Ye want to be rich, famous, an' powerful like the rest, don't ye? Aye, else ye wouldn't be here.
> 
> Well, don't be thinkin' this is a cakewalk. Ye'll be payin' yer dues, and there's plenty of 'em to be paid. By the way, me name's Ira Hess. Ye can call me 'Sir' or simply 'Taxman', that's what I does here, but don't let me catch ye badmouthin' me behind me back.

As he turns to leave, he shouts behind him:
> Personally, I don't think ye has what it takes. Best to run yer yellow butt back to where it came from.

**Dank Domain** is basically a bulletin board built around a medieval role-playing atmosphere (or is it the other way around?). Instead, you _live_ the online game as you kill, steal, brawl, and joust the other members to gain levels and fortune. The success of this game is dependent upon the users that play it. Your involvment will not only provide you with entertainment, but also shares your activity with the other players. Please take some time to read the other sections and enjoy the game!

### Basics

The Taxman hears your footsteps behind him and turns:
> Didn't heed me advice, worm? All right, but don't say I didn't warn ye. There's some things ye need to know first if ye hope to make it here, not that I think ye will anyway.

Here are some tips worth knowing:

- Whenever a prompt asks for a username, you can enter a "?" for a listing by level.
- At prompts preceded by [MAX=], you can just type "max" rather than enter the entire amount.
- Defeating a Blessed user transfers their Blessing to you - you will receive +10 bonus points to all your character abilities.
- Being defeated by a Cursed user will transfer the Curse to you and apply a -10 penalty to all your character abilities.
- Be sure to spend your money as soon as you get it. The better your equipment, the more money you will get in the Dungeon. Hoarding gold might attract the Taxman.
- Jousting is a quick way to get some much sought-after cash, especially at the beginning.
- Do NOT swear anywhere on the system. There are dire consequences to those that do.

### Character Classes

> Ye'll be needin' to choose a profession that ye want to pursue here as well. From the looks of ye, I'd recommend shovellin' manure, but that ain't one of yer options. Ye'll just have to find one ye might not be TOO incompetent in.

Character classes define the nature and tendencies of a character. Some may hit for more damage, such as the Barbarian, but must pay a higher price to use magic. Others may be able to weave intricate spells, but are poor in physical combat. Each is listed below, with an explanation of benefits and shortcomings:

**Alchemist**
    is a master of using poison, getting a 4x bonus when using it on his weapon. Alchemists receive extra Intellect points when gaining a level.

- Advantages: Can buy poison cheaply and do a great deal of damage when using it.
- Disadvantages: Can not buy any magic at all, poor combat abilities without poison.

**Assassin**
    is similar to a ninja in abilities, making him a worthy opponent. Assassins gain extra Dexterity points upon gaining a level.

- Advantages: Can use poison well, and generally gets a backstab.
- Disadvantages: Must purchase expensive wands.

**Barbarian**
    is the strongest combat-class fighter in the game, but most susceptible to the effects of magic. A Barbarian's hitting power grows as he gains more experience; there will be a point when he can hit for as many points barehanded as with weapons. Barbarians gain extra Strength points per level.

- Advantages: Very hard hitter.
- Disadvantages: Poor magic resistance, must buy wands.

**Bard**
    is a jack-of-all trades, an entertainer. Bards gain extra Charisma points per level.

- Advantages: Can do it all.
- Disadvantages: Can not do any of it _well_.

**Cleric**
    is a devout fellow with good magic and combat abilities. Extra Charisma points are awarded with each level.

- Advantages: Normal use of magic spells, can possess very high Charisma.
- Disadvantages: Poor Dexterity, poor poison use.

**Fighter**
    is a one-man killing machine. Fighters gain extra Stamina points when gaining a level.

- Advantages: Tough opponents.
- Disadvantages: Poor poison use, must purchase wands.

**Jester**
    is best described as an "annoying pest". Though their combat ability is sorely lacking, they are great at dodging blows. Jesters receive bonus Dexterity points upon gaining a level.

- Advantages: Use spells, can backstab, good robbing ability.
- Disadvantages: Ineffective poison use, weak combatant.

**Magician**
    is the magical counterpart of the fighter - strong magical abilities, but weak in physical combat. Magicians gain bonus points to Intellect per level.

- Advantages: Use spells well.
- Disadvantages: Ineffective poison, weak physically.

**Ranger**
    is a specialty-fighter with a number of abilities. Rangers gain extra Stamina points when gaining a level.

- Advantages: Use scrolls, can hit fairly well.
- Disadvantages: Cannot use poison, does not excel in a particular area.

**Rogue**
    is similar to a Thief, but do not specialize in one ability. Rogues are awarded extra Charisma points when gaining a level.

- Advantages: Use scrolls well, good backstab, good robbing ability.
- Disadvantages: Ineffective poison use, poor physical combat.

**Sage**
    is the weakest in physical combat, but Sages' spellcasting ability rivals that of a God-class. Sages gain extra Intellect points when gaining a level.

- Advantages: Super-powered magic.
- Disadvantages: Ineffective poison use, poor stamina.

**Thief**
    uses stealth abilities to sneak in a deadly backstab. Thieves, accordingly, also have the best chance of robbing. This class gains Dexterity points every level.

- Advantages: Great backstab, good poison use, excellent robbing ability.
- Disadvantages: Uses wands, weak regular attacks, poor Charisma.

The Paladin, Titan, and God classes are described in the section: [Becoming Immortal](#becoming-immortal). :trophy:

### Arena

> Think ye're a force to reckon with, do ye? Well, the monsters and your fellow grubs will put ye back in yer place, that I assure ye. Better stick to somethin' safe, like joustin'... or needlepoint!

The arena is the proving grounds, where you test your mettle against monsters and other users. It is relatively safe, as you can retreat at any time, but do not get too complacent - if you wait until you are too far down on Hit Points you may get killed by a powerful blow before you can escape. You can do battle against other users here by typing "U" and providing the levels you want listed. You can only fight someone higher than or up to three levels below you. If you win, you receive experience points, any money they might have in their hand, and their Blessing, if they have one. You will also get their armor and weapon (if it is better than yours). If you are killed, however, your opponent may take your better weapon and/or armor.

When you kill a user, they will remain dead until either they log on again or are Resurrected. If you kill a user of higher level than you, they will only be worth the experience points of your level until they log on again. For example, you kill a level 25 Fighter when you are at level 18. If that player becomes Alive! again, the attacker that kills him again, in the interim, will only gain level 18 experience points.

Several semi-intelligent denizens like to compete for cash and prizes as well. When doing a Monster Fight, start at the bottom and work your way up slowly. You may do up to three Monster or User Fights per call (or any combination thereof).

The Arena also features a jousting field. Here you enter a best-of-five-passes match against a user you specify. Each win increases your Joust Status by two points, each loss decreases it by one point. If you win, you will get a set amount of money, determined by the Experience Level of your opponent. If you lose, your opponent receives the money for your level. You will also gain Joust Status points upon gaining a level. You may joust up to three times per call.

You can also cast a non-combat spell and poison your weapon here to ready yourself for battle. In addition to this, you may type "Y" to bring up a mini-status screen. There is even an alley that leads to the Square, but be forewarned - another user may "accidentally bump" you and pick your pocket here.

### Dungeon

> If ye want a REAL challenge, go kill some monsters in the Dungeon - that's where the real money lies. If ye're not scared, that is. Best watch out, though, 'cuz there's plenty of surprises to trip ye up. And if ye run into another limp-livered coward like yerself down there, he's like to mistake yer ugly face for a monster and attack. Maybe ye'll even find the Legendary Wishin' Well down there, but ye'd probably mistake it for a chamberpot.

When you enter the Dungeon, you will start on the floor one higher than your Experience Level. Each mazelike level will vary in size; the lower you go, the possibility of a larger floor size. Do not bother keeping maps, as each level is randomly generated each time you enter. The top half of your screen holds a top-view of the current dungeon floor. The player's position is highlighted as -YOU-. The bottom half of the screen is for a rolling, text display. The prompts will guide the player along their adventure. Please note that the dungeon will accept most cursor keys as a substitute for the directions: North, South, East, West.

:dragon_face: The Dungeon is filled with monsters to slay, most of them commensurate in might to the Dungeon level. On occasion, though, a more powerful creature will work its way up to one of the higher levels, so watch out. Sometimes you will find another user on the Dungeon level matching their Experience Level. Some monsters keep maps of the Dungeon level they are on. If you find one, you will be able to display all rooms on that level. If your Intellect is above 50, you will be able to keep a map of all the rooms you have been in. A key follows:

- Mon: A room inhabited by a monster.
- Mob: A room inhabited by a mob of monsters!
- ?: Unknown.
- (Clr): The Cleric, who can heal your wounds (for a price).
- (Wiz): The Wizard, which will allow you to teleport out of the Dungeon, up or down a level, or randomly teleport to a room on the current Dungeon level.

There are many other items you can find as well. Potions of all types, as well as wands and scrolls, can be found in empty chambers and hidden caves. But beware: sometimes a monster or an armor-spoiling bat may be lurking in the shadows of these "safe" rooms too. Some monsters might even possess weapons that can not be purchased in the Square. These Weapons or Armor may be cursed or have an ego, giving them unique powers.

Pay attention to the directions available to go in the Dungeon. Running into a wall will cause damage to your Hit Points. :skull:

### Gambling Casino

> Short on cash, are ye? Well, the gods tend to smile on the foolish, so you should stand a good chance. Maybe ye'll even win the Monster Jackpot - and I'm sure ye'll be willin' to fork over the city's share to me.

:game_die: In addition to Blackjack, Craps, Dog Racing, High Card, Keno, Roulette, and the Slots, you can also deposit or withdraw money via the Instant Cash Machine.

### Naval section

> No, this area don't deal with yer bellybutton, knave. We're talkin' ships here. Get yerself a REAL ship instead of that little dinghy an' ye might be able to bring back a seamonster carcass an' sell it. Or ye can do battle against another mangy cur like yerself and lay claim to their booty. But if ye think ye'll be doin' some fishin' for relaxation, think again!

In the Naval Area, you must first visit the Shipyard to buy a boat once you have saved up enough money. You can then arm it with a ram and one cannon per 50 Hull Points. Once you have made your purchase, you can hunt either denizens of the deep or other users. Hitting "L" will display which users have ships, as well as how powerful those ships are. Each time you log on your Hull Points are restored, though lost Hull Points can be repaired in the Shipyard during the same call.

From this menu you can also fish, which will yield some interesting results. I will not spoil the fun by telling you everything that can be caught, but the higher your Charisma, the better chance you have of catching beneficial items. You will, on occasion, catch oysters - the value of their pearls are based directly on how many cannons your ship has.

### Party Fights

> There's strength in numbers, but four cowardly gnats like yerself still won't amount to much. Others got the same idea, an' they'll be more than happy to show ye THEIR strength. If ye think yer gang's tough enough, take on the Monster Mash an' see how some REAL partyin's done!

To get in on Party Fights, you must either join an existing gang or start one of your own. To see if there are any openings, select "L" to list all gangs. Any that have slots saying "-empty-" are available for your membership. Alternately, a gang leader may invite you into a party - you will receive the invitation in your notes when you log on. Listing gangs at this point will show your handle with (Invited) after it in the party into which your presence has been requested. You may want to check the Most Wanted List to ensure that the gang you are about to join does not have a past history of taking a beating on a regular basis. You may resign from a gang, if you have not used your party fight that call.

If you would like to form your own Party, simply select "S". You will then be asked to supply a name for your gang. Once that is complete, you can edit the gang, inviting potential teammates. Do not invite users that are already in a gang - chances are slim they will leave theirs for yours. The perfect gang combination consists of a heavy-hitter (Barbarian, Fighter, or Ranger), poison-using class (Alchemist, Assassin, Thief), magic-using (Sage, Magician, Cleric, Jester), and jack-of-all-trades (Bard or Rogue). Keep this in mind when selecting other members. If you do not invite specific users into the gang, any user has the option of joining.

As gang leader, you may have the option to replace undesirables at any time. If you would like to put someone else in charge, you can use "T" to Transfer Leadership. Note that if a member of your Party kills you, that person automatically assumes leadership.

Any of the four, possible members that have joined the gang may initiate combat with another Party. Only gang members with Alive! status can participate in the gang battle. Any time another Party is defeated, the victors divide the spoils (based on Experience Levels) of all money that was in the losing gang members' hands. If the defeated gang was powerful enough, you will also gain a level. Be sure to use "Y" to check your statistics during battle, and keep in mind that discretion is indeed the better part of valor - if your Party is defeated, you will be logged off. If you are defeated during the fight, your call will only continue if you go up an Experience Level and receive more Hit Points.

### Square

> Ye'll need to be doin' some shoppin' if ye stand a chance of survival. Not a high one, mind ye, but a chance. Of course, once ye get some coinage saved up, I expect ye'll be doin' yer part to keep this fine city runnin'!

The Square is your character's online shopping mall. The Armory and Weapon Shoppe allow you to buy and sell the tools of your trade.

Real Estate and Security are very important - they help to keep you from getting robbed by other users.

And you will probably be paying more than a few visits to Butler Hospital, where you can heal your wounds for a small fee. If you cannot afford to heal all your Hit Points, the Hospital will sympathize and take a loan out for you from the Bank. You can try to Pick Pockets in this busy sector, if you are careful not to get caught by the city guard. And you can take the alley leading to the Arena.

In the Mages Guild, you can buy magical wands, scrolls, or spells, depending on which your class uses. As more energy must be expended to create wands, they cost considerably more and may become inoperative after each use. Scrolls are cheaper, but may also be consumed in the casting as are wands. If your class is fortunate enough to use spells, you only need to buy each once and it will stick with you until you reach Immortality. Each spell is described:

- Charisma, Intellect, Strength, Dexterity: Each of these will temporarily raise each respective ability from one to ten points each time it is cast, to a maximum of their class allows.
- Shield, Hone: These will augment your weapon and armor. Be careful not to augment them too much!
- Teleport: This spell replaces the Wizard in the Dungeon. It can also be cast as a defensive, escape measure in battle.
- Heal, Blast: These are used to restore lost Hit Points or cause an opponent to lose some.
- Resurrect: This spell will bring a dead user back to life so they can be killed again.
- Confusion: This will distract your enemy in battle, making them miss and their spells fail more often.
- Transmute: This spell will permanently change your opponent's weapon to something of lesser value.
- Cure: This spell will restore ALL lost Hit Points.
- Illusion: This spell will summon an ally of the same qualities of the caster.
- Disintegrate: This will completely atomize your opponent.
- Morph: This spell, which can only be cast in battle, will randomly change your opponent's character class and level. Note that you could make him more powerful, a God class, or force an extermination, a class of None.

All spell-casting attempts are subject to failing or even backfiring. :scroll:

The Apothecary sells poison, which will enhance your blade in battle. The more expensive the poison, the better the damage, though some of the lesser weapons can not hold a good dose of the better poisons. Classes unfamiliar with the use of poison must pay extra for a special blend which has been magicked to adhese to the blade, while those very familiar with the application of poison may be able to get several doses out of one small vial. The Apothecary has preconceived notions about certain classes, however, and will not sell poison to certain character classes for fear of being reported to the authorities.

Ye Olde Stone Bank is a relatively safe place to store your excess cash, though it has been known to be robbed on occasion. When you are short on cash, the banker may even see his way clear to grant you a loan based on your Real Estate and Security assets. If you are feeling lucky, you can try to Rob the Bank, but the chance is very slim, as the Bank hires the best of security.

### Tiny's Tavern

> I'll let ye go in and check this out for yerself. Tiny an' me's not on the best of terms.

You enter the Tavern and are amazed by the size of the barkeep - he must stand over seven feet tall. His appearance - and abnormal height - lead you to believe that human blood is not the only type flowing through his veins. He finishes drying a flagon, places it with several others, and makes an adjustment to the sword hanging above his mantle. He then turns toward you and speaks:

> New customer, huh? OK, here's the rules, and I'm only gonna tell ya once, punk. There's some rough-housing that goes on here, so I'll letcha get away with three brawls. A lotta loose talk breezes through here, so you'll wanna keep your ears cocked as well. If you wanna keep up on what's going on in the world, I keep a couple of newspapers lying around here to read. He points a meaty finger at a chart on the wall and continues. "Other people put bounties on the ones that done them wrong. You can put up one of your own, chalk's right there on the sill. Me, I've seen it all working here - gimme a decent tip and I'll give ya one right back. But you'd best watch your mouth, punk, or I'll take ya down a notch. I can stand a little abuse, but some things I just don't tolerate.

With that, he flexes a mighty bicep and continues his cleaning. :beer: :poultry_leg:

In the Tavern, you can Brawl another user of higher or up to three levels below you. If you win, you receive one third of the experience points for killing them and any money in their hand. If you lose, your opponent will get the same, and you will be knocked unconscious for anywhere from one to ten minutes. Watch out for those wild punches - your enemy may duck and you will hit an unintended target, who may in turn join in the fracas.

You can also listen to or join in the arguments going on here. A log is kept of the current and previous days' activities for your review. Or you can have an ale and talk to Tiny, who may have some good advice for you. You can also vent frustrations by Swearing at Tiny, but do not make a habit of it or the consequences could be dire.

If you want to exact revenge on someone, but they are too high or low a level for you to do it personally, you can post a Bounty on them, offering an added incentive for another player to do your dirty work. There can only be one active Bounty on a user at any given time. Once another user kills the person you had a Bounty on, they receive your posted cash. If you kill the user that you had a Bounty on, it is lifted.

### Other Options

> There's some other things ye can do here too, so don't let me catch ye sittin' around not doin' anythin'. Ye got two minutes on the sundial to make a decision, then ye'll be escorted to the city limits for malingerin'.

The following lists options from the Main Menu not previously covered.

- (L)ist of Users: Fame & Lame allows you to display the list of users that have obtained the best scores in several categories.
- (M)ost Wanted List: This command will display the top users in descending order of level.
- (R)ob/Burglarize Other Users: By using this command you can attempt to steal money from another user. When you do, their possessions will be slightly downgraded. There is a chance that the user robbed from will be informed who did the deed. The better the real estate and security of your target, the longer it will take for you to break in, and the better the chance the city guard will catch you in the act.
- (U)ser Configuration: This allows you to change your terminal emulation, number of rows displayed, and password. You can also toggle Expert Mode, which will suppress menu display.
- (X)-terminate: This option will reset your character and allow you to select a new class. Note that you do not get credit for this type of reroll, and if used as an Immortal class, you will lose the option of selecting that class again.
- (Y) Your Statistics: This displays in-depth character information. A secondary screen is also shown that informs you how close you are in the Hall of Fame for both Character Class and All-Time categories. For an amount of money based on your level, you can Hire a Scout to show the character statistics for another user.
- (Z) System Status: This area displays registration info.

### Becoming Immortal

> Ye really think ye can make it to God status? I doubt ye can even make it to Paladin. I've seen a lot smarter than ye fail, jellyfish.

**Paladin**: This class is the lowest of the superbeings, combining a Ranger's combat skills with a Bard's use of scrolls, and an Assassin's use of poisons and backstab. Their robbing ability is fair as well.

**Titan**: This class has a Fighter's skill with a Magician's spellcasting ability. They can also use poisons and rob very well.

**God**: This class combines a Barbarian's strength, a Sage's spellcasting power, a Thief's stealing ability, and an Alchemist's use of poison.

All Immortals gain two points in each ability as they gain an Experience Level.

To advance to the Immortal classes, you must successfully solve the Riddle of the Keys. :key:

When you reach Experience Level 100 in any class, you will be presented with a locked doorway, and given four keys - platinum, gold, silver, and copper. If you have made the Hall of Fame in any area, you will be given a Key Hint, such as "Key #2 is not silver". You must then supply which key you will try in the lock. If you guess correctly, you will be rewarded with a {Click!} and are advanced to Paladin class. If not, a ^BOOM!^ and you will be rerolled and must select from the lesser classes. To attain Titan class, you must unlock the second doorway as a Paladin; to become God class, you must unlock the third doorway as a Titan.

The Taxman escorts you back to the city gates. He says in parting, patting his coin pouch:
> That's it for yer tour, mongrel. I hope ye enjoyed it. I'm sure I'll be seein' ye again real soon.
