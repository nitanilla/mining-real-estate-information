# RealEstate

## Abstract
The aim of our project is to create a system for predicting real estate prices for use
by valuation agencies, banks or the government. This work will help evaluate the
fair market value of real estate. For this purpose, we have examined the relationship
between the fair market values and attributes of the properties that have been
subject to real valuation reports in the past periods. Our dataset includes
information about properties in districts of Ankara that were subject to valuation
reports. However, the dataset does not have a proper structure and includes lots of
missing values. We have dealt with these issues and proposed a Random Forest
model for price prediction. We tried some neural network models also. Finally we created a Shiny user interface for easier analysis.
