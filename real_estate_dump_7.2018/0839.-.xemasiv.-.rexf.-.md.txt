Real Estate Exchange Format (REXF) is a listing format that favours convention over configuration.

## Goals

#### Compact

* Simple & digestible: informative 'enough' for real estate agents/brokers/owners and their clients.
* Concise: not too long, but still informative; hence not too short. 
* Timely: easy to create, easy to read. Easy to skim, comprehensible in less than 30 seconds.
* Portable: enables easier integration, sharing and interpretation between real estate platforms.  

#### Internationalized & Localized

* The International version focuses on  **generalized, middle-ground & vague** classifications.
* Local versions, which are by country, are extended from the International version, focuses on providing **specific & idiomatic** classifications.
```
For example, a "Baita" in Italy, or a "Chalet" in Switzerland, is generally a "Cabin" or a "Cottage".
```

#### Structured

* Follows a flow, some attributes have dependencies, others don't.
* Attributes are designed for search, supporting the following operations:
  * Sort
  * Filter
  * Group By

#### Extendable

* MLS-compatible, compliant to the Real Estate Transaction Standard (RETS) by Real Estate Standards Organization (RESO).
