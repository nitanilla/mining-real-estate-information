# dc-probate
D.C. probate court costs calculator for Python 3.x.

## Features
This is a simple Python script that calcuates the court costs for a probate estate opened in the District of Columbia.

The program asks the user if the estate is carrying any real property in D.C. There is a $25 assessment for any such real property, which the program adds to the final court costs.

The program then asks the user to enter the value of the personal assets in the decedent's D.C. estate, including the proceeds from the sale of any real estate.

## Usage
The program asks you to input the value of the decedent's *gross estate* without any currency ($) or commas (,). 

## Disclaimer
This program **does not offer legal advice**. If you have any questions regarding the administration of a District of Columbia estate, you should speak with a qualified probate attorney.

## Testing Notes
This code was developed and tested in Python 3.4.2. It will not work in Python 2.x.
