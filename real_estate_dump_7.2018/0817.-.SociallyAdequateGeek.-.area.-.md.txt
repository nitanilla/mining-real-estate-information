Aladdin Real Estate Advisor (AREA)
Make data-driven real estate investment decisions by de-mystifying your property portfolio

The problem:
- BlackRock and our clients struggle to easily reason about their real estate portfolios in a centralized, integrated, and highly available platform.
- Systems typically consist of several 3rd party software systems glued together with obscured business processes built into Excel
- We are not taking advantage of the collective power of Aladdin to manage these ‘real assets’
- Finding relevant information required to respond to operational events quickly and efficiently is a major challenge

Our solution: 
- Manage risk by visualizing and understanding your real estate portfolio
- Quickly identify overexposure to high-risk tenants, markets or industries
- Perform market and risk analysis using unconventional data sources 
- Simplify asset management by searching through mountains of documents and centralizing property level details
