---

### In the beginning...

Since its humble beginnings in a friend’s garage in 1998, Larry Page and Sergey Brin have transformed Google into a multi-billion dollar technology juggernaut with 84 offices in 47 countries spanning 6 continents (the only one without an office being Antarctica...for now).

### Products
Due to its rapid growth, Google has expanded its portfolio beyond its core search engine service to include online productivity software including email (Gmail), a cloud storage service (Google Drive), an office suite (Google Docs), a social networking service (Google+) and an online video streaming service (YouTube). In addition it is also behind the world’s most popular mobile operating system (Android) and in recent years has started making its way into the hardware business with its Chromebook line of laptops, Nexus line of smartphones and Google Fiber internet service.

### Perspective

 Here are some numbers, to put the size of Google's operations into perspective.

- **40,000** - Average number of Google Searches per second. This amounts to **3.5 billion** searches per day and **1.2 trillion** searches per year (Google Search Statistics, n.d.).
- **6 billion** -  The hours of video that are watched each month on YouTube (Statistics, n.d.).
- **20 petabytes** - The amount of information processed by Google's servers in one day (1 petabyte = 1,000,000 gigabytes) (Gunelius, 2013).
- **$59.825 billion** - Google's Total Revenue in 2013 (United States Securities And Exchange Commission, 2013). If it were a country it would rank 74 out of 192 countries in terms of 2013 GDP (World DataBank, 2013).

Google's success, can in large part, be attributed to its speed and ability to scale its operations.  While official numbers have never been released, it is estimated that Google has at least 900,000 servers to run all it services (Miller, 2009).  The bulk of these servers are housed in datacenters Google has built in strategic locations around the world to handle all the traffic it receives and keep their services running uninterrupted.

### Why?

Datacenters are expensive.  They are expensive to build and they are expensive to operate.  It was reported that Google spent $7.3 billion in 2013 on datacenters alone (Miller, Google Spent $7.3 Billion on its Data Centers in 2013, 2014).
So why build them in the first place? Because they allow Google to have complete control over all aspects of the information they process and store.  With Google expanding its datacenter locations around the world and funding the undersea fiber optic cables that connect them, Google has control over almost every point in your data's journey around the world.  This is important to Google as it can guarantee the security and speed of the data at it travels across the world’s networks.  The location of these datacenters is chosen very carefully as a number of very important factors must be present for a site to be considered suitable.

#### Factors

- _Availability of large amounts of cheap electricity_

    Datacenters require massive amounts of power to run and cool all their servers.  Google considers the exact amount of power one of their datacenters uses to be a trade secret, but in 2010 they revealed that altogether they consume 260 MW of power (Glanz, 2011). That’s 260 million watts.  That’s more power than the city of Salt Lake City uses (Chan, 2011).

- _Google’s commitment to carbon neutrality_

   Because of the amounts of power required to run a datacenter, Google has become a big supporter of using renewable energy.  So far, Google uses renewable energy to power over 35% of its operations and is actively involved in growing the industry with over $1.5 billion in funding agreements committed towards renewable energy projects (Google Inc., n.d.).

- _Availability of a large water supply_

    Servers produce heat. A lot of heat. And when you have thousands of them in one building, keeping them all cool can become very costly.  Because of this, Google has situated many of its datacenters near large bodies of water and uses them as massive thermal reservoirs.

- _Large chunks of land_

    For security reasons, it is important for Google to build its datacenters on large parcels of land.  This allows for a large buffer zone between nearby roads and the datacenter and makes the facility easier to secure.  In addition, the extra land real estate can also be used to install wind farms or solar panels to act as supplemental power to the datacenter.

- _Fast connections to other data centers_

    The advantages to having a powerful datacenter are rendered moot if the connections in and out of it are slow.  Because of this, Google chooses sites based on their proximity to other Google datacenters as well as their proximity to large backbone networks that can transmit their data quickly over very large distances.  Displayed on the map are the locations of the undersea fiber optic cables that Google has (publicly) funded.  They are shown to add extra perspective in to their choice of datacenter locations.  There are hundreds of these undersea cables in operation today that criss-cross the globe and Google uses many of them.  Which ones they use exactly is not publicly known so they aren't shown on the map.

- _Others..._

    Some other factors that play a role include a countries political climate, its regulatory institutions, and threat of natural disasters.

_Note that the US based data centers are not covered in this report._

# Quilicura, Chile

Chile is the home of Google's first foray into Latin America.  After the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America is the fastest growing region for new internet users in the world (European Travel Commission, n.d.).  Many had expected Brazil to be Google's choice when it inevitably moved into the region however Chile won out over its larger sibling for a variety of reasons.

- **Government**: Chile is one of South America's most stable and prosperous nations (BBC, 2012).  On the international stage, Chile is also very active.  It was also one of the founding members of the United Nations, it is a member of the UN Human Rights Council and is currently one of the five non-permanent members on the UN Security Council (United Nations, n.d.).  These factors are important for multinational companies like Google when they are considering investing their resources in a country as it shows that Chile has a stable, functioning government and there is a low risk to their investments from a political point of view.

- **Economy**: Chile has the highest degree of economic freedom in South America and ranks 7th worldwide (By comparison, Canada is 6th) (The Heritage Foundation, n.d.).  In 2010 it became the first South American country to join The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an organisation whose purpose is to promote policies that will improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world (OECD, 2010).  Chile's policies towards foreign investment are simple and transparent.  This makes it straightforward for foreign investors, such as Google, to conduct their business with little restriction, and it allows them to access Chile's official foreign exchange market to repatriate their profits and capital.

- **Geography**:  Chile sits in the Pacific Ring of Fire, a series of oceanic trenches, 40,000 km long that forms a horse-shoe shape around the Pacific Ocean from Chile to Alaska, across to Russia, and down to Australia.  The Ring is so called for its extremely high seismic activity and number of volcanoes.  It encompasses 75% of the world's active and dormant volcanoes and is responsible for approximately 90% of the world’s earthquakes (Bioexpedition, n.d.).  In 2010, Chile was struck by a massive 8.8 MW earthquake.  At the time it was the 5th largest earthquake ever recorded and actually altered the Earth changed the speed of the Earth’s rotation (Than, 2010).  Events like this are cause for concern for Google and might limit the amount it invests in the future as they jeopardize their investments in the country.  They might be more willing to invest more heavily in their other data centers, such as Hamina, where natural disasters rarely occur.

# Hamina, Finland

Google's data center in Finland was built inside an old paper mill situated just outside the small town of Hamina, on the coast of the Baltic Sea (Google Inc., n.d.).  Compared to its data centers in the Asia-Pacific region, where locations are chosen based on the hosts country's political climate and network infrastructure, Finland was chosen for its cool climate and geographic stability.  One of the unique features of the Hamina site is that raw sea water is piped through one of the paper mill's existing tunnels to cool all of the servers in the data center naturally (Google Inc., n.d.).  The water is cold enough that Google does not need to cool the water before using it allowing it to drastically reduce its energy consumption needs.  The Hamina data center is one of two Google data centers that is "chiller-less", the other being in Belgium.

- **Climate**: Finland is cold. In July, it averages 13 - 17 degrees Celsius (WeatherOnline, n.d.). From an energy consumption standpoint, this makes it an ideal location to run a datacenter and keep its thousands of servers from overheating without having to spend a fortune on cooling costs.  (For Google, this can be in the hundreds of millions of dollars). As it's in the Arctic Circle, Finland has a cold, temperate climate that is almost subarctic but at the same time, comparatively mild due to the moderating influence of the North Atlantic Current, Baltic Sea, and it’s more than 60,000 lakes (CIA Factbook, n.d.).  In other words, it's cold but not too cold.  In addition, in the past 30 years, Finland has very rarely suffered any natural disasters and has a very low risk of earthquakes, making it an ideal location to invest $340 million to build a data center (Prevention Web, n.d.).

- **Energy**: The Hamina data center is one of the most energy efficient data centers in the world.  One of Google's priorities when building its data centers has been to minimize, as much as possible, its carbon footprint.  To that end, in January 2014, Google announced that it had signed a deal to buy the entire electricity output of a new wind farm being built  in neighbouring Sweden to power its Finnish data center (Verge, 2014). This was in addition to its 2013 announcement that it had signed a similar deal to buy the entire ten-year output of a separate Swedish wind farm in order to offset the carbon costs of running its Hamina data center (Verge, Google Powering Finnish Server Farm with Swedish Wind Farm, 2013). The move helped cement Google's green energy claims while at the same time protecting it from fluctuating energy prices.

# St. Ghislain, Belgium

Belgium is the home of Google's first European data center (Google Inc., n.d.).  Like Finland, Google chose to build a datacenter in Belgium because of its cool climate and developable land.  Located near an industrial water canal, the facility is water self-sufficient as it draws water from the canal in to its 20,000 sq. ft. water treatment plant.  The water is filtered and treated just enough that it can be used to cool the servers in the data center which is collocated to the water treatment plant. Belgium's climate is cool enough that Google does not need to chill the water before using it which drastically reduces its energy consumption needs (Verge, Google Invests $390 Million to Expand Belgium Facility, 2013).  The St-Ghislain data center is one of two Google data centers that is "chiller-less", the other being in Finland.  It is considered water self-sufficient as it only uses 100% recycled water and not potable (or drinking) water for its cooling needs (Google, 2009).

# Eemshaven, Netherlands

In the Netherlands, Google recently announced it had broken ground a new datacenter in the industrial sector of Eemshaven on the coast of the North Sea.  It expects the facility to be fully operational by the end of 2017.  From the first day it becomes operational, Google plans to power the facility using 100% renewable energy from a nearby windfarm currently being built in nearby Delfzijl.  Google has bought the entire 10 year output of this windfarm to power its data center.  Eemshaven is also the landing point of an undersea fiber optic cable that connects Europe to the US which Google will certainly make use of.

# Dublin, Ireland

Google has built up a large presence in Dublin, Ireland. It is the home of its European Headquarters, as well as two data centers.  The first data center opened in September 2012 with the second one currently under construction (Verge, Dublin Officials Green-light Google Data Center, 2014).  Dublin has also attracted other tech giants in setting up shop in the country including Microsoft, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, HP and Dropbox (McDonald, 2012).

- **Climate**: Like its other data centers in the European region, Dublin was chosen for its cool temperatures.  While it isn't completely chiller-less like its brethren in Belgium and Finland, it does make extensive use of the cool sea air blowing in off the coast to chill its servers allowing it to reduce cooling costs.

- **Governement**: In 2009, Ireland was one of the hardest hit countries of the global recession.  However even at that time, an American independent technology research company Forrester Research, urged US companies to establish themselves in Dublin because besides its cool climate, Ireland also has a young, highly-educated workforce and a very low corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent (Irish Central, 2014). This is half the global average and almost a third of the North American average (KPMG, n.d.).  This makes it very cheap for Google to do business and is why Dublin has attracted other high profile tech companies to the area.

# Changhua County, Taiwan

Changhua County is the home of Google's largest datacenter in the Asia-Pacific region (Yu-Tzu, 2013).  It was chosen because of its reputation as a high-tech hub, strong support of foreign investment, and its location right in the heart of Asia.  One of the unique features of this facility is its use of a nighttime cooling and thermal energy storage system.  It works by cooling the water stored in its storage tanks at night when the air is cooler, and then uses that cool water during the day to cool its servers when the temperatures are hotter (Google, n.d.).  From the heat map you can see that Google receives a lot of traffic from Japan, China, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore. Taiwan was chosen over these other countries (except Singapore) for a variety of reasons.

- **Government**:  The government of Taiwan is very to open foreign investment and does not impose strict restrictions on transnational companies that wishing to set up shop within its borders.  They also do not attempt to censor or filter any of Google's services or traffic as is the case with China which sits on the other side of the Taiwan Strait, a mere 180km away.  China plays a large role in determining where Google places its datacenters in the Asia-Pacific region due to its large population and the traffic they generate.  When Google was first planning its expansion into the region it had planned to build a datacenter in Hong Kong along with the ones in Taiwan and Singapore however that plan was later cancelled (Kim, 2013).  The relationship between the US based Google and China has gone through many ups and downs due to China's tight grip on the flow information within the country and often blocks or restricts access to Google's services (Google, n.d.).  Having a much more open government to work with, while still being close to the large amount of users in China, allows Google to keep its services running in the region as smoothly as possible.

- **Economy**: Although Taiwan's population ranks 52nd in the world in size, its economy ranks 21st thanks to its high tech industry (CIA, n.d.).  It is one of the Four Asian Tigers, and is a member of the WTO and APEC.  In addition, the regulatory environment of Taiwan is very stable and accommodating which means Google doesn't have to worry about new laws coming into effect that could, in effect, jeopardize its operations and investments in the country.  The cost of living in Taiwan is also low which perhaps also played a factor in Google choosing Taiwan over other countries such as Japan where the cost of living and the cost of land is much higher.  This is an important factor as it lowers the cost of operating the data center.

# Singapore

Although it is a small island on the southern tip of Malaysia, Singapore is one of the world’s major commercial hubs boasting the world’s fourth-largest financial centre which houses some of the world’s largest banks, businesses and stock exchanges (Mark Yeandle, 2014).  It is also a huge shipping and logistics hub with the 2nd busiest container port in the world (World Shipping Council, 2014)  Singapore is a highly modern city-state located in one of the fastest-growing market for Internet users in the world.  Its advanced infrastructure and economy make it an ideal location for Google to build a data center.

- **Network**: Singapore would not be the global commercial hub today if it wasn't one of the world’s most well-connected countries.  The South-East Asia Japan Cable (SJC) is an undersea fiber optic cable that is jointly owned by Google that connects 7 countries in South East Asia (Lee, 2013). It provides 28 Tbps (Terabits per second) of bandwidth and its landing point in Singapore is only a few blocks away from Google's data center.  The SJC cable is just 1 of 28 undersea fiber optic cables that come into Singapore and provide it with lightning fast network communications connecting it to other major cities around the world. By comparison, Canada has 6 undersea cables connecting it to other countries (TeleGeography, 2014).
One of the other landing points of the SJC cable is Chikura Japan, which from the map, you can see is the landing point of 2 other Google-owned undersea fiber optic cables, Unity and FASTER (Chowdhry, 2014).  The FASTER cable will be a 60 Tbps fiber cable connecting the US West coast to Japan in 2016.  On the US side, one of FASTER's landing points is Bandon, Oregon, the same state that houses Google's The Dalles datacenter.  The Unity cable is a 3.3 Tbps fiber cable that also connects Japan to the US West coast, this one landing in Redondo Beach, California.  It is worth noting that Google's worldwide headquarters is located on the US west coast in Mountain View, California, just outside San Francisco.

# Conclusion

Google does not take its decisions lightly.  As you can tell, there are a lot of factors that go in to deciding each location and the importance of each one varies by region.  Everything from a countries political tendencies and economic policies to its geographic stability and climate are all weighed in an effort to make the most informed decision possible.  Billions of dollars is spent by Google in every region of the world in order to allow its users fast, uninterrupted access to its services, most of which are offered for free.  Altogether, Google is driving innovation and pushing the limits of the world’s network infrastructure and data centers.  Hopefully this will give you pause for thought the next time you are watching a cat video on YouTube.
