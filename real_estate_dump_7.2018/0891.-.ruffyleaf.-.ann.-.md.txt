Artificial Neural Networks with R

Applications of NN
------
* Predicting stocks
* Predicting currencies
* Predicting bond prices
* Predicting commodity & energy prices
* Credit scoring
* Real estate appraisal
* Targeting direct mail marketing

Theory Behind NN
--------

It consists of several nodes. Each node has several weights or inputs and 1 output. A NN consists of several nodes with their outputs providing inputs to other nodes.

A simple form of a NN is a Perceptron, which is a type of linear classifier.

Training the NN
-------

The learning process starts with the output layer to start and works backwards. Also called back propagation.

Too many layers - Have to beware of over fitting because it becomes a poor predictor.
