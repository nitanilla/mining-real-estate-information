Duplex Real Estate Investment Calculater

Feel free to checkout the demo: https://ancient-sands-24557.herokuapp.com/

I built this application with a small team to help out a local real estate agent who wanted to create a single page web application she could host on her site that would help her bring in new clients interested in buying a duplex. 

We used the MEAN stack as well as Angular-Google-Charts and Angular materials. We were asked to implement a minimalist styling so that when she updated her site in the next few months the next development team could easily make revisions.
