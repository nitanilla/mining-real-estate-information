# Real Estate API Fun

NOTE: Trulia is discontinuing their API as of September 29, 2016.

Programming Languages: Python

Libraries used: json, requests, xmltodict

Trying out a few popular real estate sites' apis.

trulia.py: This uses Trulia's API.  I'm not a huge fun of this API: the documentation is 
meager, it only returns XML and doesn't have a lot of options of data to receive.  
I tried out the xmltodict library to turn it into a dict so that you can treat it like a 
json.
