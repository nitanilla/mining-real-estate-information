Estate agency software for WP. Market properties on your website, manage contacts and applicants, or expand the features through add ons

== Description ==

Property Hive is the first plugin that aims to bring all of the features you'd normally find in estate agency software into WordPress.

From managing residential and commercial properties, owners and landlords, to tracking applicants, matching and emailing them suitable properties, we want to do it all.

= Why Property Hive? =

There are many estate agency software options available on the market, but here's why we think you'll love Property Hive:

**Only use the features your business needs**

By default Property Hive is a property and contact management tool, allowing you to manage your property stock, list properties on your website, record owners details, store applicants requirements and email suitable properties to them.

Through use of premium add-ons however, you can choose which features you want to bolt on. The add ons fit seamlessly into the existing plugin, and with each other.
 
Want to send your properties to property portals? There's an add-on for that.
Want to add Draw-A-Search functionality to your website? There's an add-on for that.

Our add-ons are priced individually from just £14.99 meaning you only pay for what you use.

You can [view all of our add-ons](https://wp-property-hive.com/add-ons/ "Property Hive Add-Ons") on our website.

**Works with any new or existing theme**

Property Hive isn't a theme. It's a platform allowing you to integrate property search into any website, new or existing. For more details on supported themes [click here](https://wp-property-hive.com/which-wordpress-themes-work-with-property-hive/) or get started with our very own free open-source theme [Honeycomb](https://wp-property-hive.com/property-hive-website-themes/honeycomb//).

**Integrates with the major software providers and property portals**

If you already use software such as Jupix, Vebra, Dezrez, Reapit, ExpertAgent, LetMC and more then it's easy to get your properties imported on an automatic basis at regular intervals so they display on your website. Our [Property Import Add On](https://wp-property-hive.com/addons/property-import/) can have you and running in minutes.

Likewise, if you send properties to the portals such as Rightmove, Zoopla, OnTheMarket and Gumtree, we have various add ons to allow the exporting of properties to these sites.

**Millions of developers**

Property Hive isn't developed by one person, or a small team. It's built by the world. Property Hive is open-source meaning anyone can contribute, regardless of which country they're in, or how much existing knowledge of the plugin they have already. 

Want to build a new feature? Maybe fix a bug you've found? As long as you have an understanding of PHP and WordPress, or know someone that does, you can make the changes yourself. What's more, your hard work will be received gratefully by everyone else that uses the plugin.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 3.8 or greater
* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Property Hive, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "Property Hive" and click Search Plugins. Once you've found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the Property Hive plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Screenshots ==

10. Editing a contact record - The 'Relationships' tab contains all of the relationships that you have with this contact (i.e. in the event they're a landlord of two properties)
11. Record an applicants' requirements. Allows for one or more set of requirements in the case where someone is looking to buy and rent.
12. View a list of properties that match the applicant's requirements. You can them email these properties to the applicant.
13. Enquiries made on the site are available from within WordPress. Assign them to a negotiator and mark them as 'Closed' once complete.
