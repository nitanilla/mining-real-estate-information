<b>Our Mission:</b>

Our mission is to create a virtual reality social platform where developers and artists can collaborate, share models and ideas, and work together to build interactive 3D virtual worlds. It is our belief that this new method of content creation will allow for increased creative productivity, a more social means of buying, selling, and sharing in-game assets, and a fun, original way for people to work together to build virtual worlds in a fully immersive VR environment.

<b>Project Description:</b>

Another World is a virtual reality community where artists, game developers, and visionaries can collaborate to build fully immersive, interactive worlds. Users can build their own custom worlds from the ground up, or visit and interact with the worlds that others have created inside the Another World universe. In addition to featuring an in-app set of tools, models, and materials which allow users to piece together their ideas and bring their visions to life, custom assets can be uploaded then used to create a more personalized experience or shared with others. Shared models can be used for in-app world creation or downloaded to be used in outside projects giving developers a new, immersive way of viewing 3D assets in full VR. Assets can be bought and sold amongst artists and developers searching for high quality custom designs for their work, or simply shared by those looking to get exposure for their work or to collaborate on building with a creative partner. Another World aims to provide a true social virtual reality experience, allowing users to interact with others across the world from the comfort of their VR headset as they collaborate, share, and explore their creations. Worlds all begin as a barren plane, but as users populate them with terrain, buildings, and whatever else their minds envision, they begin to come to life and evolve to make up the vibrant, ever-changing Another World universe.

Another World is currently being developed for the Oculus Rift, with plans on expanding to other VR platforms.
