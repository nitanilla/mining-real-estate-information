This project has been created to address a glaring gap in the rails ecosystem: the lack of an open source project for real estate websites.

The result is that WordPress has become the dominant tool for creating real estate websites.  This is far from ideal and PropertyWebBuilder seeks to address this.

Read more about this here: [http://propertywebbuilder.com](http://propertywebbuilder.com)

## [Demo](https://propertywebbuilder.herokuapp.com/)

You can try out a demo at [https://propertywebbuilder.herokuapp.com](https://propertywebbuilder.herokuapp.com/)

To see the admin panel, login as user admin@example.com with a password of "pwb123456".

You can see an example of a production site created with PropertyWebBuilder here:

## Create your own real estate website with no technical knowledge

The simplest way to create a website with PropertyWebBuilder is to use Heroku, a trusted service provider which has a free plan that you can use.

Just [sign up for Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/identity), click the button below and in a few minutes your site will be ready

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/etewiah/pwb-for-heroku)

You may be asked for credit card details when you create an account but you will not be charged for creating and trying the website. You will only need to pay if you upgrade the service.  Here is a video about how to deploy to heroku:

## Install as a standalone site

PWB has been designed to be included as an engine in an existing Ruby on Rails app.  In this repo I have a Ruby on Rails app that includes PWB.

[https://github.com/etewiah/pwb-for-heroku](https://github.com/etewiah/pwb-for-heroku)

As the name suggests, the project can be deployed to heroku but it can also be installed locally as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/etewiah/pwb-for-heroku.git
cd pwb-for-heroku
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails pwb:db:seed
rails pwb:db:seed_pages
```


## Installation within an existing Rails app

Install into an existing Rails project by adding these lines in your applications's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pwb', git: 'https://github.com/etewiah/property_web_builder', branch: 'master'
gem 'globalize', git: 'https://github.com/globalize/globalize'
gem 'paloma', github: 'fredngo/paloma'
```

Also, be sure to use Postgres as your database (by having the "pg" gem and Postgres installed locally - version 9.5 or above)
And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Mount the PropertyWebBuilder by adding the following to your routes.rb file:
```ruby
mount Pwb::Engine => '/'
```

and run the ff commands from the console:
```bash
rails pwb:install:migrations
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails pwb:db:seed
rails pwb:db:seed_pages
```

Thanks to the awesome [Locale](http://www.localeapp.com/) contributing to the translations is super easy!

- Edit the translations directly on the [property_web_builder](http://www.localeapp.com/projects/public?search=property_web_builder) project on Locale.
- **That's it!**
- The maintainer will then pull translations from the Locale project and push to Github.
