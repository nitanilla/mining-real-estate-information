Morningstar Fixed Income Classification System Map (MFICS)
==========================================================

This library just aims to enable lookups in the reference table of Morningstar as published on their [website](http://corporate.morningstar.com/us/documents/MethodologyDocuments/MethodologyPapers/MorningstarGlobalFixedIncomeClass.pdf) in an easy way by building a Node module containing a JSON map and some methods to explore it.

## Installation

```shell
npm install morningstar-fixed-income-classification
```

## Usage

```javascript
var MFICS = require('morningstar-fixed-income-classification');

MFICS.all()

Some municipal bonds are backed by the issuing entity, while others are linked to a revenue stream, such as from a toll way or a utility. Municipal bonds in the United States are typically exempt from federal taxes and often the taxes of the states in which they are issued. Those taxation advantages may allow municipal governments to sell bonds at lower interest rates than those offered by comparable taxable bonds. This Primary Sector includes issues that are subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax but not other federal taxes. Corporate' },

## Dataset Indexing

In order to enable keyword-based searches on the MFICS dataset, we use a reverse index stored in ``/data/data-index.json``. The index is generated by tokenizing relevant properties on MFICS classifications and storing them in an index object keyed by the tokenized text. The index relates keywords to scores that represent the likelihood that a specific keyword is related to a MFICS classification.

In order to rebuild the index run the following command from the project directory:

```shell
$ ./bin/build-index.js
```
