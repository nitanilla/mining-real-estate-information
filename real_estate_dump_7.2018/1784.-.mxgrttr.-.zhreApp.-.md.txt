# Zurich Real Estate App

## First draft
This is a Shiny app for the Zurich real estate market. The app will be presented for the first time at erum 2108 and is still under development.
The code and presentation slides can be obtained from this repository. I am very grateful for feedback of any kind.

## Code and data
The code is a working version. I am happy about every hint that can make this code leaner, faster and more elegant and will of course incorporate the ideas recorded in Budapest in the coming days.

So that you can test the app yourself, I have created some play data with random numbers as prices. The Zürichsee effect, which can be seen in the slides, is no longer visible with these data.
