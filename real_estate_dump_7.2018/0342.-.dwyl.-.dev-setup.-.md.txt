# A Guide to setting up your developer environment
[![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/dwyl/setup/issues)

This repo should be **constantly evolving**. Please open issues and pull requests to include anything you think is relevant.

_Note:_ The intention is **not** to include every fancy script, tip and trick under the sun, this is about **basic setup and getting going when you're new** and already have a _steep_ learning curve!

## Who is this for?
People who are new to coding.    
Particularly people who have learnt online using inbuilt browser-based editors and tools (often the case in online courses) and have **not set up their own environment on their own computers** before.

## Why?
When we were teaching ourselves how to code it took us some time, talking to more experienced developers and trying things out to **pick up on all the small things that make our lives easier as developers**.   
We wanted there to be a single place where new developers could go to find these quickly so they can **get past the setup and down to the business of coding**.


_Note: @dwyl we use full stack Javascript.
This includes some recommendations of things we personally favour of course!_

## Text Editor
It's entirely up to you which text editor you use, but you will inevitably need one.    
At the time of writing, at _dwyl_ we use [Atom editor](https://atom.io/) (open source, NodeJS based editor) though we work with a lot of people who use [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) (and have used this ourselves in the past).

### Basic text editor setup
+ ** Set up [_soft tabs_](https://opensourcehacker.com/2012/05/13/never-use-hard-tabs/)** (indentation)
  + You can usually set this up in the _Preferences_ or _Settings_ of your favourite text editor so you never have to think about it again (example below on [Atom editor](https://atom.io/))

+ **Set up a guide (or line) to show on your page at the 80 character mark** so you know [when you go past 80 characters (or columns) on a single line](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/604/is-the-80-character-limit-still-relevant-in-times-of-widescreen-monitors)
  + Useful for _readability_, particularly in code snippets where you would otherwise end up with a scroll bar
  + You should also be able to set this up in your favourite text editor's _Preferences_ (example below again on Atom editor - note, I also like to set up my editor to soft wrap at this line length so I can read other people's code more easily)

+ **Install at least a basic [linter](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8503559/what-is-linting)** to your editor
  
### Our most used text editor keyboard shortcuts  
Each person's most used shortcuts will vary of course, but here are some of the things we suggest **learn the keyboard shortcuts for:** 
  + Select the current word (usually `cmd + D`)
  + Delete current line (usually `ctrl + shift + K`)
  + Indenting a line or a whole block of code at once
  + [Column editing](https://atom.io/docs/v1.0.11/using-atom-editing-and-deleting-text#multiple-cursors-and-selections) 
  + [Moving a line](https://atom.io/docs/v1.0.11/using-atom-editing-and-deleting-text#basic-manipulation) or block of code up and down the page
  + Changing the [syntax highlighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting) when required
  + Toggle between the different views (e.g. hide/show the file tree view to gain more screen real estate)

## Git and GitHub
We use Git and [Github](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) exclusively for our version control and to share our work with the world.   
Understanding the [difference between the two](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/git-and-github-what-s-the-difference) is also helpful :blush:

### Basic Git setup   
+ Sign up for a [Github account](https://github.com/join)
+ **[Set up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) on your computer**
  + We recommend you [**authenticate with SSH**](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/#connecting-over-ssh) as this is more secure and means you _won't have to type in your password every time you push to GitHub_
  + _Note:_ This also means that when you _clone_ a repo, you'll need to use the **SSH clone URL** (thanks [@tsop14](https://github.com/tsop14) for the screenshot!)

### Learn how to use Git + GitHub 
+ There are many resources online, [here are a few we like](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here#git--github)
<a name="git-in-the-terminal"/>
+ Although [Git has a desktop client](https://desktop.github.com/) we **recommend that you learn to use it on the command line** - this is _much_ faster in the long run and will serve you well as a developer

## Terminal
+ There are many _themes_ which you may have heard of (like [Oh My Zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/)) that aim to add some functionality and shortcuts to your terminal - **we _don't_ recommend you use any terminal themes when you're starting out**. Until you know what you're doing in the terminal, relying on these keeps you from becoming proficient in the basics.
+ Similarly, a good number of us currently use [iTerm](http://www.iterm2.com/) as our terminal emulator but you really don't need to have one straight away - iTerm just provides some nice features like split panes :+1:
