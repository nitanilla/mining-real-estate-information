# Denver Real Estate Analysis

The two links below encapsulate my Springboard Data Science Intensive capstone project. It is an analysis of single family home sale prices from 2008-2016 in Denver, Colorado. It begins with an exploratory data analysis of two datasets from Denver's Open Data Catalog, moves into some work on a machine learning algorithm to predict home sale prices, and concludes with a few takeaways and thoughs on next steps.
