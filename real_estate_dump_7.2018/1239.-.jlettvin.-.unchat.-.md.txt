# unchat

Several value-add concepts are married in this nascent application.
## split window separation of chat participants
* your train of thought remains visible after large entries by others
* split size maintenance through window resize
* quick identification of other user without consuming screen real estate
* rapid independent local scrolling of each participants messages

## asynchronous character at a time chat
* watch what your colleague is typing as they are typing it
* be prepared to respond to inquiries more quickly
* have faster and more complete communication
* support for scientific communication/visualization

## wiki markup within the chat
* be able to organize ideas much like mediawiki (wikipedia)
* use graphing, charting, equations, HTML5, and much much more
* swap back and forth between markup and rendering with a single keystroke
* special markup for checklists (progress tracking)

## future developments
* more than two participants
* high security methods to maintain privacy, auditability, non-repudiability
* sandboxing of security risks such as external calls to programs
