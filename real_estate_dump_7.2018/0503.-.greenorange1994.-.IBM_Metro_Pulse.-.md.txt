These are codes for finishing this project.
It is a one-month competition. We need to create a real estate growth prediction model.  

greenorange1994 is responsible for dealing with missing data, coming up with the model - bagging KNN, writing codes for the basic version of KNN with block bootstrapping and creating two shiny apps including interactive maps and plots to show data summary and prediction summary.
