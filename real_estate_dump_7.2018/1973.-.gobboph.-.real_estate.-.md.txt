# Real estate in NYC

This is an ongoing project where I plan to compare the real estate value of each area of New York City with the type of business present in the area.

The data about the businesses currently operating in NYC can be found [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/Legally-Operating-Businesses/w7w3-xahh). Wherease I use [these data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/pluto-mappluto-archive.page) to assess the buildings' value.
