# Hedonic Regression
Quick example of using linear regression for real estate valuation for homes
in the Boston suburbs.


## Summary 

R's [`lm`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/lm.html)
function for linear model fitting was used for a Hedonic regression to predict
with fair accuracy the median value of owner-occupied homes. While there was
some doubt as to the effect of independent variables `CRIM,` `INDUS`, `AGE`
and `B`, a model including all the independent variables available seemed to
work best at prediction.

### Cleaning the data

The original `data/housing.data` had columns delimited by varying amounts of
whitespace, so vim was used to clean up the file and change the delimiters to
commas.

### Fitting a linear model for Hedonic Regression

The basic model used was

    model1 = lm(MEDV ~ ., data=...)

This specifies the `MEDV` column as the dependent variable, and treats all
other columns as independent variables. Note that the `CHAS` column was
converted from an integer to a factor.

As the model using all independent variables was reporting questionable
levels of effect of independent variables `CRIM,` `INDUS`, `AGE` and `B`,
a second model not including those variables was also created.

Plots for fitted-values vs. residuals, as well as those for theoretical
quantiles vs. standardized residuals seemed to show very little difference
between the two models. However, the first model using all thirteen of the
available independent variables had a lower Adjusted R-squared value of
0.7192, compared to the second model using nine independent variables
(Adjusted R-squared of 0.722).

### Verifying the models

The data was randomly shuffled and then split into a training set with
400 rows, with the remaining 106 rows used for validation.

[Mean squared error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error)
was used to measure the differences in accuracy between our two models,
with a lower score implying greater accuracy.

The results:
* model 1: 18.756444 
* model 2: 18.896384 

Predictions using both models were output to file under
`data/predictions_model*.csv`

Plots of the predicted `MEDV` vs. the actual `MEDV` values using both models
were created. The accuracy of the models is visually interpreted as the
distance of a point from the diagonal line y=x. 

#### Model 1 accuracy using all 13 variables

#### Model 2 accuracy using 9 variables

Since Model 1 has a lower mean squared error even when including all thirteen
of the independent variables available in the given dataset, we suggest that
Model 1 be used.

As the points in this plot seem to lie fairly close to the diagonal,
we conclude that the linear model works very well for Hedonic regression.
R's `lm` and `predict` functions are well-documented, easy-to-use,
and the results are reasonably simple to interpret and comprehend.
