**Final Asignment Funda Coding Challange 2017**
For Funda Real Estate we got the assignment to workout a prototype based on a user story.
I chose to add more information to a specific house about the neighbourhoood. This way the user can select a house based on practical and social manners.

**My Prototype**
Since we only had one week the prototype is not very advanced and only some features work. 
As a user you can manipulate the dataset of Funda. You can select the neighbourhood and price range.

It might be that this demo is not working any longer. Funda told us they would block the API key after a couple of months.
