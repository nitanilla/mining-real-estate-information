# Todo

* Index page NOI not rounding decimals

# Done
* Add link as db field
* Add constant defaults as placeholder value

# Notes
* Cap rate is basically same as 1% rule - should be at least 8.51% for 1% rule

# Credits
* The psuedo-spreadsheet and formulas were copied from an actual spreadsheet distributed by Ryan Persitza in a class called Real Estate Finance (481) at UW-Milwaukee.
