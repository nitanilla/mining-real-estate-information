# Problem Statement
ChennaiEstate is a real estate firm based in Chennai that is involved in the property business for the past 5 years.
Since, they are in the business for so long, they have enough data of all the real estate transactions those have taken
place in the city.
They decided to venture into Analytics and have now started a division called “Chennai Estate Analytics” to give
consumers as much information as possible about housings and the real estate market in Chennai. A home is often
the largest and most expensive purchase a person makes in his or her lifetime. Ensuring real-estate owners have a
trusted way to monitor the asset is incredibly important. Hence, they have hired you as a consultant to help them
give insights and develop a model to accurately predict real estate prices.

Based on the train dataset, you will need to develop a model that accurately predicts the real estate price in Chennai.
