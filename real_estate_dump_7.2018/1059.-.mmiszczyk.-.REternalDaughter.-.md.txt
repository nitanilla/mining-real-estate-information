REternal Daughter v 1.0.0
=========================

About
-----
REternal Daughter is a reverse engineering project for a freeware
video game Eternal Daughter. It attempts to fix issues with running
the game on modern machines.

Eternal Daughter is a metroidvania (open world 2D platformer) by
Blackeye Software (Derek Yu and Jon Perry). It was released as
freeware in 2002. More information about the game can be found in
[this article written by the author of REternal Daughter]
(http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/eternaldaughter/eternaldaughter.htm).

REternal Daughter can run the game in a window. It is als able to run
the game in a supported 640x480 resolution without upscaling (game as
a 'window' within a black screen or surrounded by screen borders stored
in img.bmp file). Experimental upscaling feature can be enabled by a -u
command line switch, although it has issues with levels smaller than
640x480 (see below). Compared to the original game, it uses a newer
version of Cncs232.dll which may fix some of the issues related to MIDI
playback.

REternal Daughter also includes a save editor saveutil.py. It's still
incomplete but the most important features are there.

Issues with Eternal Daughter
----------------------------
Eternal Daughter runs natively in a 320x240 resolution which is too low
for modern GPUs. It also has problems with its MIDI playback functions
as if a music track changes while a sound effect is playing, the sound
effect will loop endlessly and the game will become unplayably slow.

Usage: I just want to play the damn game already!
-------------------------------------------------
If you want a version of Eternal Daughter that will work on modern
computers and can't be bothered with all that reverse engineering stuff,
[just download that file and you're good to go]
(https://github.com/mmiszczyk/REternalDaughter/releases/download/1.0.0/REternalDaughter.7z).
This is a collection of pre-patched binaries with an easy to use launcher
that should work out of the box.

If you want to know more, customize the patches, edit savefiles or maybe
even try a bit of reverse engineering yourself, read on. Keep in mind
that while there are no prerequisites to running the pre-patched
version, everything else requires you to have Python 3 with the
following packages installed:

+ hy
+ bsdiff4

Reversing Eternal Daughter
--------------------------

### Binary patches ###

Eternal Daughter was created with an old version of Multimedia Fusion,
a game engine relatively popular among indie developers for its
user-friendly 'no programming' approach.

![Eternal Daughter.exe info](images/exeinfo.png)

Game logic seems to reside completely inside Eternal Daughter.exe.
The game also loads a dynamic library Cncs232.dll which contains
multimedia-related functionality (presumably, this includes buggy
MIDI/sound effects code).

Unfortunately, Eternal Daughter.exe also contains all the game data as
there are no files containing sprites or sounds anywhere in the game
folder. Even worse: all that data seems to be in custom formats as
Resource Hacker is unable to extract any images or music. Even strings
table doesn't contain the in-game text, just standard diagnostic
messages. Opening Cncs232.dll with it is similarly fruitless: it has
a few bitmaps but nothing similar to game content.

![Eternal Daughter.exe in Resource Hacker](images/reshack.png)

![Cncs232.dll in Resource Hacker](images/reshack2.png)

As quick google search doesn't show any way of extracting data from
compiled Multimedia Fusion games, the only thing left is disassembling
the game and fixing what we can. The resolution is an obvious choice:
I step through game startup in OllyDbg, find the place from which
resolution data is pulled and write a simple fix. I hijack the game's
execution early by calling to a code cave near the end of the
application's text section. In that cave, I overwrite relevant data
section fragments with 640x480 (values here presented in hex), call the
function that should have been called instead of my hook and return to
normal flow.

![Fixing resolution](images/fixres1.png)

This appears to be working well: the whole game is drawn in higher
resolution and it looks good. Unfortunately, there are problems here and
there. The minor one is that triggers in cutscenes are visible. The
bigger one is that if you come from a bigger level to a smaller one,
those larger portions are not redrawn and it looks stupid. You can
enable this option with -u command line switch in reternal.py but it's
not the default.

![Everything seems fine](images/hi-res.png)

![But it doesn't work the way it should](images/hi-res-glitch.png)

I change my strategy: the game will run in a higher resolution but
it's not going to be upscaled. I modify the executable again, this time
hardcoding  640x480 in two functions that draw the window and leaving
the values from the data section intact for drawing game content.

![Fixing resolution: another attempt](images/fixres2.png)

Of course, the game now isn't really in high resolution. It's still
in 320x240, it's just that the game window is bigger so the GPUs don't
go crazy. It also doesn't look as well as it should but it's far less
annoying than the previous version.

![Not optimal but works](images/low-res.png)

I then turn my fixes into a Python/Hy (Python because rapid prototyping,
Hy because I like Lisp-like syntax) program. There's a lot more that can
be done but I think it's a decent start. In REternal Daughter, this
behavior can be enabled with a --noborders command line switch.

### bmploader.dll ###

Non-upscaling patch wastes a lot of screen real estate, with the game
being played in a small rectangle in the middle of a black screen. The
simplest solution here would be to do what the developers of shmups
(and other games designed for vertically-aligned arcades) do: just draw
the borders around everything. Because of the issues with upscaling mode,
I assume it should be easy: just draw it once inside the game's window
and nothing should overwrite it.

After trying and failing to this in assembly, I decide to write
a library in C++ and just call a necessary function from assembly.
I then try to add the function as an import using a variety of Portable
Executable editing tools. They all fail miserably so I do what every
good programmer/hacker/cracker/reverser would do in this situation:
I harness the power of Google, enter a carefully chosen query
('reverse engineering games') and absorb the knowledge (I ask for help
on the first site that pops up in results).

[A very helpful user](https://github.com/Andoryuuta) sends me some code
which starts a process and injects a DLL into it. I modify my library
to do everything in the DllMain function, inject it and fail. Strangely
enough, Andoryuuta (the user who sent me the injector) is able to get
it to work without issues. I try to educate myself about why this might
be the case and discover some articles about session separation on
different versions of Windows. I write my own injector which uses
NtCreateThreadEx and therefore should bypass session separation.
Unfortunately, the problem lies elsewhere ad this also doesn't work, and
anything that uses NtCreateThreadEx pisses off antivirus software.

I manage to do a binary patch (not unlike the upscaling one) that hooks
execution and calls LoadLibraryA. Unfortunately, the borders get
overwritten for some reason so I adopt the strategy proposed by
Andoryuuta: spawning a thread and drawing in a loop. This looks good
on screenshots but in-game there's a lot of very annoying blinking.
Still, I make the most of what I have and turn some old Eternal Daughter
fanart into a suitable bitmap.

![Imagine this but with blinking](images/borders.png)

This behavior can be enable with -b command line switch.

### Binary patching 2: Windowed Daughter ###

In [Mastigophoran's Let's Play](http://lparchive.org/Eternal-Daughter/),
he claimed to have found a way to enable windowed mode by hex editing
the game's executable. While I wasn't able to get in touch with him,
I contacted Azurinel, a prominent Eternal Daughter speedrunner and
[world record holder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2zXlis3jF0)
(spoilers, obviously). Azurinel knew the details of Mastigophoran's
modifications, [which are described here](http://pastebin.com/qvL3q00V).
With this patch, I've been able to get the game to run in windowed mode.

![Eternal Window](images/window.png)

This patch didn't enable windowed mode by default, it only fixed the
non-implemented /NOF command line switch. To make my patch more
standalone, I also replaced the call to GetCommandLineA with my fake
function which returns a hardcoded string ending with /NOF.

![Because strcat in assembly is too much work](images/enablewindowed.png)

This is the default behavior as it's the least problematic one (no
additional glitches, no unused screen real estate, no blinking).

Based on the informations from Mastigophoran's pastebin, I also made
a patch which upgrades Cncs232.dll to a new version. I haven't done
enough testing to confirm whether it fixes all MIDI issues but if it
doesn't, the project still has a lot to do.

Reversing save files
--------------------
Eternal Daughter uses slotX.sav for holding saved games, where X is
a number between 1 and 3. They store binary data and opening them with
a hex editor gives us a hint about what to do next: the first 8 bytes
contain a magic number which is a representation of ASCII string
'CNC ARRAY'.

![Savefile in hex editor](images/savefile.png)

'CNC Array' is the format used by Multimedia Fusion to store
the engine's array objects. According to a post by Dines, user of
Clickteam forums, the format works as follows:

    offset  type    details
    -----------------------
      - HEADER CHUNK -
    0000    ascii   "CNC ARRAY"
    0009    byte    Null
    000A    dword   Always '2' for some reason. Maybe version number?
    000E    dword   X dimension size
    0012    dword   Y dimension size
    0016    dword   Z dimension size
    001A    dword   Settings (see note 1)
    001E    (Data chunks follow from here)
    
      - DATA CHUNK (number array) -
    0000    dword   value of this item in the array.
    
    This repeats for every element in the array, until it reaches
    the end of the file. There is one dword per element.
    
      - DATA CHUNK (text array) -
    0000    dword   Length of text
    0004    ascii   Stored text
    
      - Note 1 (Flags/Settings) -
    This shows the meaning of the various bits in the flag byte:
    
    -------- -------- -------- ----gbtn
    g = Global Array (1 = yes)
    b = 1-Based Array (1 = yes)
    t = Text Array (1 = yes)
    n = Number Array (1 = yes)
    - = Bit is not used.

Do note that in hex editor, byte 000A stores the value '1' while the
post claims it's always '2'. This seems to confirm the poster's theory
that this is a version information variable. Looking further into the
file, its settings variable (001A) stores the value of 5. In binary,
a DWORD representing 5 is 29 0s followed by 101. Therefore, each save
is a 1-indexed array of 32-bit integers.

Through trial and error, I discovered the meanings behind some of the
variables in savefile:

|Offst |Variable           |Comments  -                                            |
|:----:|:-----------------:|-------------------------------------------------------|
|0x1e  |Health              |-                                                     |
|0x22  |Double jump         |True/false                                            |
|0x3a  |Current gems (ammo) |Can be larger than max                                |
|0x42  |Hammer              |True/false                                            |
|0x56  |Max gems            |Can be lower than current                             |
|0x5e  |Mojak               |True/false                                            |
|0x72  |Current weapon      |1 - knife, 2 - hammer, 3 - Mojak, 4 - Ozar, 5 - Sigil |
|0x76  |Ozar's Flame        |True/false                                            |
|0x7a  |Elanduru save icon  |True/false                                            |
|0x8e  |Elanduru's form     |0 - none, 1 -3 - young, 4 - adult, 5 - adult with mask|
|0x96  |Sigil               |True/false                                            |
|0xaa  |Attack power        |-                                                     |
|0xc6  |Current location    |-                                                     |

I use that knowledge to write a save editor/analyzer.

TODO
----
+ better upscaling (draw empty window after switching stages?)
+ find a way to stop the border image from blinking
+ add missing features to save editor

REternal Daughter was written by Maciej Miszczyk. Andoryuuta provided
a lot of help with DLL injection and fixed a bug in the third patch so
the border-drawing function probably wouldn't happen without him.
Most of the fourth patch was made following Mastigophoran's instructions
provided indirectly by Azurinel so they too deserve a mention - there
wouldn't be windowed mode without them.

The picutre currently used as a border taken from [a fanart gallery in
this Let's Play](http://lparchive.org/Eternal-Daughter/) but I don't
know anything about the author beside the fact that his name is Igor.
