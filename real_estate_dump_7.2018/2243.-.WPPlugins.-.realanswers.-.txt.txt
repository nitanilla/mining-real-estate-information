Real Estate Answers plugin enables you to host a real estate Answers for a metro, city, ZIP, or property in your sidebar.

== Description ==

Real Estate is being discussed everywhere on the Internet.  Why not bring the real estate conversation to your weblog?  This real estate plug-in allows you to join a "network" of real estate web sites who are growing their traffic through real estate answers.  Real estate questions are sourced by participating web sites, pooled together, and made available to all members of the network.  Answers are provided by local real estate agents and moderated by RealtyBaron.  Most importantly, visitors **remain on your weblog** to browse questions and answers.  No traffic is sent to us.  We simply operate the engine in the background.

**Real Estate Agents**: Don't just participate...own the real estate "conversation" on your own blog!

Features include:

* __Free__ - no cost to download, install, and/or use the plug-in.
* __Revenue__ - a new source of revenue from advertising embedded in answers.  Ad impression, click tracking, and payment collection is handled by RealtyBaron.
* __Search Engine Optimization (SEO)__ - When you source a question, a clean "follow" link back to your weblog on all web sites publishing that question.
