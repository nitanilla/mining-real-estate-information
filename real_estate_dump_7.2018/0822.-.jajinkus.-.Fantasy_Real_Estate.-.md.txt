# Fantasy_Real_Estate

Fantasy Real Estate is an online game much like fantasy football, but you're investing in real estate. Users make rent "money" in the game from properties they own based on the estimated market value of the property. Users can sell properties to other users, upgrade properties to increase market value and recieve the value of the property when the it is sold in real life.
