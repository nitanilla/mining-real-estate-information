## Model Evaluation & Validation
## Project: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

Welcome to the first project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!

In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.

>**Note:** Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the **Shift + Enter** keyboard shortcut. In addition, Markdown cells can be edited by typically double-clicking the cell to enter edit mode.

## Getting Started
In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.

The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:
- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.
- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.
- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.
- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.

Run the code cell below to load the Boston housing dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project. You will know the dataset loaded successfully if the size of the dataset is reported.


```python
# Import libraries necessary for this project
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import ShuffleSplit

# Import supplementary visualizations code visuals.py
import visuals as vs

# Pretty display for notebooks
%matplotlib inline

# Load the Boston housing dataset
data = pd.read_csv('housing.csv')
prices = data['MEDV']
features = data.drop('MEDV', axis = 1)

# Success
print "Boston housing dataset has {} data points with {} variables each.".format(*data.shape)
```

    Boston housing dataset has 489 data points with 4 variables each.


## Data Exploration
In this first section of this project, you will make a cursory investigation about the Boston housing data and provide your observations. Familiarizing yourself with the data through an explorative process is a fundamental practice to help you better understand and justify your results.

Since the main goal of this project is to construct a working model which has the capability of predicting the value of houses, we will need to separate the dataset into **features** and the **target variable**. The **features**, `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, and `'PTRATIO'`, give us quantitative information about each data point. The **target variable**, `'MEDV'`, will be the variable we seek to predict. These are stored in `features` and `prices`, respectively.

### Implementation: Calculate Statistics
For your very first coding implementation, you will calculate descriptive statistics about the Boston housing prices. Since `numpy` has already been imported for you, use this library to perform the necessary calculations. These statistics will be extremely important later on to analyze various prediction results from the constructed model.

In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
- Calculate the minimum, maximum, mean, median, and standard deviation of `'MEDV'`, which is stored in `prices`.
  - Store each calculation in their respective variable.


```python
# Minimum price of the data
minimum_price = np.min(prices)

# Maximum price of the data
maximum_price = np.max(prices)

# Mean price of the data
mean_price = np.mean(prices)

# Median price of the data
median_price = np.median(prices)

# Standard deviation of prices of the data
std_price = np.std(prices)

# Show the calculated statistics
print "Statistics for Boston housing dataset:\n"
print "Minimum price: ${:,.2f}".format(minimum_price)
print "Maximum price: ${:,.2f}".format(maximum_price)
print "Mean price: ${:,.2f}".format(mean_price)
print "Median price ${:,.2f}".format(median_price)
print "Standard deviation of prices: ${:,.2f}".format(std_price)
```

    Statistics for Boston housing dataset:

    Minimum price: $105,000.00
    Maximum price: $1,024,800.00
    Mean price: $454,342.94
    Median price $438,900.00
    Standard deviation of prices: $165,171.13


### Question 1 - Feature Observation
As a reminder, we are using three features from the Boston housing dataset: `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, and `'PTRATIO'`. For each data point (neighborhood):
- `'RM'` is the average number of rooms among homes in the neighborhood.
- `'LSTAT'` is the percentage of homeowners in the neighborhood considered "lower class" (working poor).
- `'PTRATIO'` is the ratio of students to teachers in primary and secondary schools in the neighborhood.

_Using your intuition, for each of the three features above, do you think that an increase in the value of that feature would lead to an **increase** in the value of `'MEDV'` or a **decrease** in the value of `'MEDV'`? Justify your answer for each._
**Hint:** Would you expect a home that has an `'RM'` value of 6 be worth more or less than a home that has an `'RM'` value of 7?


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

for var in ['RM', 'LSTAT', 'PTRATIO']:
    sns.regplot(data[var], prices)
    plt.show()
```


![png](output/output_7_0.png)



![png](output/output_7_1.png)



![png](output/output_7_2.png)


**Answer: **

I'd expect an increase in feature:
- `RM` to result in an increase in `MEDV`, since homes with more rooms are generally bigger and cost more to construct, leading to higher home values
- `LSTAT` to result in a decrease in `MEDV`, since neighborhoods with more working class homeowners would only be able to afford cheaper homes
- `PTRATIO` to result in a decrease in `MEDV`, since higher student-teacher ratios are generally a side-effect of a lack of resources from the school district to hire more teachers relative to their population. Homeowners in these neighborhoods generally dont have the resources to afford expensive homes.

----

## Developing a Model
In this second section of the project, you will develop the tools and techniques necessary for a model to make a prediction. Being able to make accurate evaluations of each model's performance through the use of these tools and techniques helps to greatly reinforce the confidence in your predictions.

### Implementation: Define a Performance Metric
It is difficult to measure the quality of a given model without quantifying its performance over training and testing. This is typically done using some type of performance metric, whether it is through calculating some type of error, the goodness of fit, or some other useful measurement. For this project, you will be calculating the [*coefficient of determination*](http://stattrek.com/statistics/dictionary.aspx?definition=coefficient_of_determination), R<sup>2</sup>, to quantify your model's performance. The coefficient of determination for a model is a useful statistic in regression analysis, as it often describes how "good" that model is at making predictions.

The values for R<sup>2</sup> range from 0 to 1, which captures the percentage of squared correlation between the predicted and actual values of the **target variable**. A model with an R<sup>2</sup> of 0 is no better than a model that always predicts the *mean* of the target variable, whereas a model with an R<sup>2</sup> of 1 perfectly predicts the target variable. Any value between 0 and 1 indicates what percentage of the target variable, using this model, can be explained by the **features**. _A model can be given a negative R<sup>2</sup> as well, which indicates that the model is **arbitrarily worse** than one that always predicts the mean of the target variable._

For the `performance_metric` function in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
- Use `r2_score` from `sklearn.metrics` to perform a performance calculation between `y_true` and `y_predict`.
- Assign the performance score to the `score` variable.


```python
# Import 'r2_score'
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

def performance_metric(y_true, y_predict):
    """ Calculates and returns the performance score between
        true and predicted values based on the metric chosen. """

    # Calculate the performance score between 'y_true' and 'y_predict'
    score = r2_score(y_true, y_predict)

    # Return the score
    return score
```

### Question 2 - Goodness of Fit
Assume that a dataset contains five data points and a model made the following predictions for the target variable:

| True Value | Prediction |
| :-------------: | :--------: |
| 3.0 | 2.5 |
| -0.5 | 0.0 |
| 2.0 | 2.1 |
| 7.0 | 7.8 |
| 4.2 | 5.3 |
*Would you consider this model to have successfully captured the variation of the target variable? Why or why not?*

Run the code cell below to use the `performance_metric` function and calculate this model's coefficient of determination.


```python
# Calculate the performance of this model
score = performance_metric([3, -0.5, 2, 7, 4.2], [2.5, 0.0, 2.1, 7.8, 5.3])
print "Model has a coefficient of determination, R^2, of {:.3f}.".format(score)
```

    Model has a coefficient of determination, R^2, of 0.923.


**Answer:**

Generally yes. With a R^2 of 0.923, there seems to be a high correlation between the predicted and true values of the target value, and the model nearly predicts the target variables.

### Implementation: Shuffle and Split Data
Your next implementation requires that you take the Boston housing dataset and split the data into training and testing subsets. Typically, the data is also shuffled into a random order when creating the training and testing subsets to remove any bias in the ordering of the dataset.

For the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
- Use `train_test_split` from `sklearn.cross_validation` to shuffle and split the `features` and `prices` data into training and testing sets.
  - Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing.
  - Set the `random_state` for `train_test_split` to a value of your choice. This ensures results are consistent.
- Assign the train and testing splits to `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, and `y_test`.


```python
# Import 'train_test_split'
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Shuffle and split the data into training and testing subsets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, prices, test_size=0.2, random_state=1)

# Success
print "Training and testing split was successful."
```

    Training and testing split was successful.


### Question 3 - Training and Testing
*What is the benefit to splitting a dataset into some ratio of training and testing subsets for a learning algorithm?*
**Hint:** What could go wrong with not having a way to test your model?

**Answer: **

It prevents overfitting the data, which happens the model becomes overly optimized for the training data, but poorly performs on new data.

Splitting off a testing subset from your dataset helps us identify this by allowing you to train your model on one subset and validate your model against another subset.

----

## Analyzing Model Performance
In this third section of the project, you'll take a look at several models' learning and testing performances on various subsets of training data. Additionally, you'll investigate one particular algorithm with an increasing `'max_depth'` parameter on the full training set to observe how model complexity affects performance. Graphing your model's performance based on varying criteria can be beneficial in the analysis process, such as visualizing behavior that may not have been apparent from the results alone.

### Learning Curves
The following code cell produces four graphs for a decision tree model with different maximum depths. Each graph visualizes the learning curves of the model for both training and testing as the size of the training set is increased. Note that the shaded region of a learning curve denotes the uncertainty of that curve (measured as the standard deviation). The model is scored on both the training and testing sets using R<sup>2</sup>, the coefficient of determination.

Run the code cell below and use these graphs to answer the following question.


```python
# Produce learning curves for varying training set sizes and maximum depths
vs.ModelLearning(features, prices)
```


![png](output/output_21_0.png)


### Question 4 - Learning the Data
*Choose one of the graphs above and state the maximum depth for the model. What happens to the score of the training curve as more training points are added? What about the testing curve? Would having more training points benefit the model?*
**Hint:** Are the learning curves converging to particular scores?

**Answer: **

For the graph with `max_depth = 3`, when the size of the data increases, the training score slightly declines while the testing score slightly improves until there's around `300 training points`, where both training and testing curves level off. Adding additional training points seems to have little effect beyond this point.

### Complexity Curves
The following code cell produces a graph for a decision tree model that has been trained and validated on the training data using different maximum depths. The graph produces two complexity curves â€” one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.

Run the code cell below and use this graph to answer the following two questions.


```python
vs.ModelComplexity(X_train, y_train)
```


![png](output/output_25_0.png)


### Question 5 - Bias-Variance Tradeoff
*When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?*
**Hint:** How do you know when a model is suffering from high bias or high variance?

**Answer: **

At `max_depth = 1`, the model suffers from high bias since it's oversimplified. We see this in the graph from the low training & validation scores at `max_depth = 1`.

At `max_depth = 10`, the model suffers from high variance since it overfits the training data. We see this in the graph from the divergence of training and validation scores as the depth increases beyond `max_depth = 3`.

### Question 6 - Best-Guess Optimal Model
*Which maximum depth do you think results in a model that best generalizes to unseen data? What intuition lead you to this answer?*

**Answer: **

`max_depth = 5` is where the validation score seems to hit it's peak, but it starts to flatten around `max_depth = 4`.

Thus, I'd pick `max_depth = 4` for the model to best generalize to unseen data and to avoid overfitting the model to the training data.

-----

## Evaluating Model Performance
In this final section of the project, you will construct a model and make a prediction on the client's feature set using an optimized model from `fit_model`.

### Question 7 - Grid Search
*What is the grid search technique and how it can be applied to optimize a learning algorithm?*

**Answer: **

Grid search is a technique to fine-tune the parameters of a model. It uses "brute force" to generate models for each combination of parameters, and is typically performed alongside with cross-validation to determine which set of parameters gives the best performance through some sort of scoring metric. See the [scikit-learn's docs](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) for examples of this.

It can be exponentially computationally expensive as hyperparameter space expands. For example, as each time increase the `max_depth` by 1, we increase the number of dimensions in the space that we search through. Thus we typically manually define a subset of the hyperparameter space to set some boundaries, but even that has its limits.

### Question 8 - Cross-Validation
*What is the k-fold cross-validation training technique? What benefit does this technique provide for grid search when optimizing a model?*
**Hint:** Much like the reasoning behind having a testing set, what could go wrong with using grid search without a cross-validated set?

**Answer: **

k-fold cross-validation is a model validation technique where the original sample is randomly partitioned into k equal sized subsamples. A single subsample is used as testing data for, and the remaining k âˆ’ 1 subsamples are used as training data.

The cross-validation process is then repeated k times (the folds), with each of the k subsamples used exactly once as the testing data. The k results from the folds are then averaged to produce a single estimation.

It overcomes the problem with using grid search without a cross-validated set, since by splitting the data into training & test sets only once, the size of each set is limited. With just a single validation set, grid search may very well overfit to this set.

The primary advantage of using grid search alongside with k-fold cross-validation, all observations are used for both training and validation, and each observation is used for validation exactly once. We're ensured that we're using the entire dataset for training and validation, and that we're not overoptimizing to perform well towards the single validation set that was selected.

[_source_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_%28statistics%29%23k-fold_cross-validation)

### Implementation: Fitting a Model
Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.

In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_iter'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.

For the `fit_model` function in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
- Use [`DecisionTreeRegressor`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) from `sklearn.tree` to create a decision tree regressor object.
  - Assign this object to the `'regressor'` variable.
- Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.
- Use [`make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html) from `sklearn.metrics` to create a scoring function object.
  - Pass the `performance_metric` function as a parameter to the object.
  - Assign this scoring function to the `'scoring_fnc'` variable.
- Use [`GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) from `sklearn.grid_search` to create a grid search object.
  - Pass the variables `'regressor'`, `'params'`, `'scoring_fnc'`, and `'cv_sets'` as parameters to the object.
  - Assign the `GridSearchCV` object to the `'grid'` variable.


```python
# Import 'make_scorer', 'DecisionTreeRegressor', and 'GridSearchCV'
from sklearn.metrics import make_scorer
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

def fit_model(X, y):
    """ Performs grid search over the 'max_depth' parameter for a
        decision tree regressor trained on the input data [X, y]. """

    # Create cross-validation sets from the training data
    cv_sets = ShuffleSplit(n_splits = 10, test_size = 0.20, random_state = 0)

    # Create a decision tree regressor object
    regressor = DecisionTreeRegressor()

    # Create a dictionary for the parameter 'max_depth' with a range from 1 to 10
    params = {'max_depth': range(1,11)}

    # Transform 'performance_metric' into a scoring function using 'make_scorer'
    scoring_fnc = make_scorer(performance_metric)

    # Create the grid search object
    grid = GridSearchCV(regressor, param_grid=params, scoring=scoring_fnc, cv=cv_sets)

    # Fit the grid search object to the data to compute the optimal model
    grid = grid.fit(X, y)

    # Return the optimal model after fitting the data
    return grid.best_estimator_
```

### Making Predictions
Once a model has been trained on a given set of data, it can now be used to make predictions on new sets of input data. In the case of a *decision tree regressor*, the model has learned *what the best questions to ask about the input data are*, and can respond with a prediction for the **target variable**. You can use these predictions to gain information about data where the value of the target variable is unknown â€” such as data the model was not trained on.

### Question 9 - Optimal Model
_What maximum depth does the optimal model have? How does this result compare to your guess in **Question 6**?_

Run the code block below to fit the decision tree regressor to the training data and produce an optimal model.


```python
# Fit the training data to the model using grid search
reg = fit_model(X_train, y_train)

# Produce the value for 'max_depth'
print "Parameter 'max_depth' is {} for the optimal model.".format(reg.get_params()['max_depth'])
```

    Parameter 'max_depth' is 5 for the optimal model.


**Answer: **

`max_depth = 6` for the optimal model, but I'd still insist on using a simpler model with `max_depth = 4` in case `fit_model` is just picking up noise and overfitting the training data.

### Question 10 - Predicting Selling Prices
Imagine that you were a real estate agent in the Boston area looking to use this model to help price homes owned by your clients that they wish to sell. You have collected the following information from three of your clients:

| Feature | Client 1 | Client 2 | Client 3 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Total number of rooms in home | 5 rooms | 4 rooms | 8 rooms |
| Neighborhood poverty level (as %) | 17% | 32% | 3% |
| Student-teacher ratio of nearby schools | 15-to-1 | 22-to-1 | 12-to-1 |
*What price would you recommend each client sell his/her home at? Do these prices seem reasonable given the values for the respective features?*
**Hint:** Use the statistics you calculated in the **Data Exploration** section to help justify your response.

Run the code block below to have your optimized model make predictions for each client's home.


```python
# Produce a matrix for client data
client_data = [[5, 17, 15], # Client 1
               [4, 32, 22], # Client 2
               [8, 3, 12]]  # Client 3

# Show predictions
for i, price in enumerate(reg.predict(client_data)):
    print "Predicted selling price for Client {}'s home: ${:,.2f}".format(i+1, price)

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

clients = np.transpose(client_data)
preds = reg.predict(client_data)
for i, feat in enumerate(['RM', 'LSTAT', 'PTRATIO']):
    plt.scatter(features[feat], prices, alpha=0.25, c=prices, cmap=plt.cm.cool)
    plt.scatter(clients[i], preds, marker='x', linewidths=2)
    plt.xlabel(feat)
    plt.ylabel('MEDV')
    plt.show()

# Show descriptive statistics for each feature\n",
print 'Features:'
print features.describe()
print 'Price:'
print prices.describe()
```

    Predicted selling price for Client 1's home: $419,700.00
    Predicted selling price for Client 2's home: $287,100.00
    Predicted selling price for Client 3's home: $927,500.00

**Answer: **

- Predicted selling price for Client 1's home: $419,700.00

- Predicted selling price for Client 2's home: $287,100.00

- Predicted selling price for Client 3's home: $927,500.00

These prices seem reasonable given the values for each client's respective features.

Client 1's home seems to reflect the typical home and our prediction is close to the mean & median selling prices.

Client 2's home seems to maintain a similar size, but is situated in a neighborhood with a bigger working-class demographic and more resource constrained school system. As such, the predicted selling price is about 1 standard deviation from the mean, which seems reasonable.

Client 3's home is much larger, with a substantially smaller demographic of working-class residents. The predicted selling price is almost 3 standard deviations from the mean and close to the the maximum selling price. I'd be a bit wary of this prediction, but with such a small neighborhood poverty level, it's still seems completely reasonable.

Stats from **Data Exploration** section for reference:

- Minimum price: $105,000.00

- Maximum price: $1,024,800.00

- Mean price: $454,342.94

- Median price $438,900.00

- Standard deviation of prices: $165,171.13

### Sensitivity
An optimal model is not necessarily a robust model. Sometimes, a model is either too complex or too simple to sufficiently generalize to new data. Sometimes, a model could use a learning algorithm that is not appropriate for the structure of the data given. Other times, the data itself could be too noisy or contain too few samples to allow a model to adequately capture the target variable â€” i.e., the model is underfitted. Run the code cell below to run the `fit_model` function ten times with different training and testing sets to see how the prediction for a specific client changes with the data it's trained on.

### Question 11 - Applicability
*In a few sentences, discuss whether the constructed model should or should not be used in a real-world setting.*
**Hint:** Some questions to answering:
- *How relevant today is data that was collected from 1978?*
- *Are the features present in the data sufficient to describe a home?*
- *Is the model robust enough to make consistent predictions?*
- *Would data collected in an urban city like Boston be applicable in a rural city?*

**Answer: **

I probably wouldn't use this model nor this data in a real-world setting today. The data is collected from 1978 and home values would likely have changed drastically by then.

But even when you're using recent pricing data, the features used are terribly insufficient to capture home values. Meaningful features like Location, lot size, square footage, actual sale prices over time of the home itself, and comparable recent sales of nearby homes have a substantial impact on home values.

For the example of location, data collected from urban Boston would almost be completely irrelevent to predict home values in Death Valley, CA.

The model itself seems to robust enough to make consistent predictions, but not exactly the most accurate ones.
