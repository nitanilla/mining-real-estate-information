## UCB Project I Proposal

## Project Title - A decadal survey on the impact of real estate prices on homelessness in eighteen major cities in the USA (2007-2017)  
Team Members – Lei, Jagatha, Angela and Weiming

### Project Description/Outline:
For this project we utilized real estate data compiled by Zillow’s Economic Research team made available on Kaggle (Zillow Economics Data), and correlated it to Point-In-Time (PIT) estimates of homelessness compiled by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD Exchange Site).  We chose to look at the correlation between homelessness and local real estate prices in eighteen major cities across the U.S. between 2007 and 2017. 

### Research Questions to Answer:
1. Is there a correlation between homelessness and real estate prices? 
2. At what rate has homelessness changed in the past decade? 
3. Which cities/regions of the country have the highest homeless counts?
4. What does the homeless population demographics look like? 

### Data Sets to be Used:
Kaggle - Zillow Economics Data (1996-2017 data)- https://www.kaggle.com/zillow/zecon/data 
https://www.kaggle.com/zillow/zecon/downloads/City_time_series.csv

### Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
1. Search for homelessness and real estate estate datasets - HUD and Zillow.
2. Clean up and combine HUD and Zillow datasets.
3. Define at what level (city/county/state) we want to look at homeless counts - dependent on HUD data.
4. Analyze and  plot the data to answer our research questions - ~2 plots/graphs from each team member.
5. Describe/explain plots in the bigger context. Challenges?
6. Clean up code and upload to Github.
7. Prepare slide presentation and markdown files.
