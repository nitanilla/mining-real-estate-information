# felinix
felinix is a FOSS CAT (computer aided translation) tool focused on speed, productivity, portability and efficient resource use

No code for this project exists as of yet, but this repository is a place-holder and interest-generator for a CAT tool that:
  
  - Is built with Python, so as to be cross-platform
  - It incorporates as many efficiencies as possible (cython/pypy where relevant)
  - Makes design decisions to allow translators to work at a high level of productivity
  - Is economic with screen real-estate, to be used comfortably on mobile and desktop devices
  - Has no limit to TM size, optimised concordancing and lookups
  - Has server, TM-sharing and collaboration functions (potential TM-privatisation features)
  - Is free and open source software, enabling professional translators to focus on their work, not licenses

Watch or Star this repo to signal your interest, or use the normal channels.

The felinix name is intended to link the concepts of the 'CAT' tool and feline-like efficiencies, as well as the 'Unix way'.
