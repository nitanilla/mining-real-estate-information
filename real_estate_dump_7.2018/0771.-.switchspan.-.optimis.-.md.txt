# Optimis

Optimis ( **OP**en Source **T**itle **I**ndustry **M**ortgage
**I**ndustry **S**oftware )

The goal of the Optimis project is to create an opensource alternative
to the current Real Estate title/escrow software packages (RamQuest,
SoftPro, etc.). Optimis aims to use
opensource standards to create a system that allows for easy integration
with third-party services and exchange of data. 
We hope to enable innovation that is just not possible with the current
commercial software. We also hope to 'Transform' the Real Estate
industry...(pun intended).

The current implementation is a web based UI with a RESTful services back
end via Rails 4.
The project uses Devise for authentication.

(And yes, I do know that the transformer is spelled 'Optimus' -- this
just goes better with the acronym)

## Prerequisites

* Ruby 1.9.3+
* Rails 4
* Bundler
* PostgreSQL

## Installation

This installation is intended for testing the software. For actual
deployment, you should deploy it like any other Rails 3 application.

* [Download](http://github.com/switchspan/optimis/archive/master.zip)
  the project.
* Now from the root of the "optimis" directory:

```shell
$ bundle install
$ rails s
```

That should start the application on 'http://localhost:3000/ for you to
run.
