About Me:

* Languages:

     * Spanish (native speaker)

 I am originally from Guatemala, Central America. Since moving to Chicago in the late '90s, I have worked in many different industries and witnessed from the service provider side how techonology, especially software applications have made scalability possible along with accuracy and effectiveness to better service the community.

 From being a licensed public chauffeur (one of the most memorable professions I've had) to supervising the massive parking logistics for the always-busy River North Neighborhood entertainment businesses. On top of that, I've been a tax preparer, investor, mortgage broker, real estate agent and a junior real estate appraiser.
