# HCT（House Coupon Token）
NAREIG House coupon token project

NAREIG (North America Real Estate Investment Group Inc.) is the first real estate firm to offer real estate coupon token on the Ethereum blockchain. The token is called HCT (House Coupon Token).

Established in Seattle, Washington in 2012, NAREIG is an international real estate firm which helps overseas buyers to invest in the U.S., Canada, UK, Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Thailand. With extensive experience in residential and commercial real estate, NAREIG is planning to tokenize real estate coupon to benefit both international and local buyers.

The NAREIG token is “a type of coupon to purchase real estate property”. Each token purchased with USD $1 cash value can be redeemed as USD $100 coupon when investors purchase properties with NAREIG (Limitations and restrictions apply).

Since our business has expanded to 12 countries1, HCT investors have lots of options when choosing where to purchase properties. Unlike other cryptocurrencies whose value fluctuate a lot, our HCT has a stable value and can be quickly liquidated in the market. The purpose of HCT is to provide a real incentive that benefits real estate buyers.

NAREIG is a US-based company with offices in Seattle, San Francisco, and Manhattan. Even though we have strategic partners in China and other counties, only NAREIG (North America Real Estate Investment Group, Inc.) will be the organization that issue the HCT.

HCT is NOT any type of security or credit fund. It is a coupon token with no expiration date.
