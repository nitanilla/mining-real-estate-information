This project aims to use an MLP neural network to solve the following problem:
An English financial institution wants to decide which clients to send an offer of a new real estate loan product. The database consists of 40700 cases, where 40000 are clients who after 12 months have not accepted the real estate loan proposal and 700 are clients who after 12 months have accepted the proposal. A neural network will be used to know which of the 40700 customers wish to receive the offer and who do not wish to receive it.

The first step is split the data in test, training, and validation, the second is to do oversampling and undersampling (smote/k-means or random) to balance the amount of data, after that the data can be trained
