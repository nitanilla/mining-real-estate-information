Real-Estate-iOS-Application

I created this as a semester project and learned iOS development in Swift 3.0
Although, it needs a lot of improvements but it can guide the beginners to create a simple iOS App which uses a service to store and receive data.

Features:
- User Sign Up and Sign In.
- A form where the user can add a new Real Estate Property information.
- A table view to see the searched listings and click on them.
- A right and left menu which uses SWRevealViewController Library. (https://github.com/John-Lluch/SWRevealViewController)
