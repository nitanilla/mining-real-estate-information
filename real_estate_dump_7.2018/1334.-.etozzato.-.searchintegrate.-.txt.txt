= What sorts of data does this program provide me? =

Search Integrate reports all terms your visitors are searching for â€“ key data which can help your optimize your blog's content and layout. This data is broken out in top searches, recent searches, and displays how frequently those terms are searched. We also display number of clicks, clickthrough rate (number of clicks compared to queries), and a daily revenue summary.

Not at all. Search Integrate complements other money-making tools you already have in place, including AdSense, affiliate programs, banner, etc. Search Integrate only appears on the search results page, inline with your normal results, so AdSense is unaffected.

No. Search Integrate does not use any existing ad or banner space. SIWP adds sponsored ad listings onto the body of your blog's search results page. No banner, header, footer or other real estate required.
