# ceasaonline-react-native
An Android app to demonstrate my skills working with React Native. CEASA Online is a collaborative app to share the daily prices of fruits and vegetables at CEASAs ("Farmers Outlets" in Brazil).

You can also install CEASA Online on your Android and see what it does. The version on Google Play was writen with Ionic 1.
