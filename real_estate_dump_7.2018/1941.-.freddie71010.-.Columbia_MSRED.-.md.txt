(Master of Science of Real Estate Development)

Real estate financial analysis tool that automatically calculates computations in real-time. Application isolates the learning process so students can focus on the analysis of input values rather than on the construct of the models. 

Students can create user accounts and save specific financial models (a model being a collection of input values) to a database to be loaded and analyzed at a later date. The user can also edit and update their individual models and re-save them to the database.

Prototype application.
