# Pige Android App
###### App for real estate search

### Disclaimer
I am not responsible for your own using of this app. 
It is my **first** android app. I wrote this for Vilnius University lecture called "Mobile application development".
Code does not use any database, any abstractions, and the architecture is poor, 
**though the main goal while writing it was learning basics of android programming.**

### What it does
Basically, the idea was to make an app where you can search for a real estate based by an address on a map.
You start with Lithuanian borders image. You need to click on a region on which you want to search for. The region you clicked goes darker and loading begins.
Then you are sent to map page, which you can explore. Markers correspond to real estate objects.
When clicked on the marker (which correspond to a house or a flat) it opens little popup with overview of the real estate object.
When clicked on the popup, sliding panel (collapsed) shows up. You can drag it up and see the gallery of images and detail information.
There is a small "star" icon on the sliding panel, which when clicked turns it color and you can mark it this way for future reviewing.
You can filter markers by price and type (flat/house).
Also, there is a contact page, which can be accessed through toolbar mail icon.
