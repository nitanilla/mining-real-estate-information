# TRUST
Cryptocurrency, real world assets.


WHAT IS TRUST


01
TOKEN
TRUST is a ERC20 smart contract built on the Ethereum blockchain.

 

TRUST incorporates all the benefits of a cryptocurrency, such as decentralisation and low barriers to entry for participants, combined with tangible real estate investments.

​

This gives rise to the TRUST ethos – “Crypto-currency, real-world assets”.

​

The token’s tie to hard assets will not only help to promote stability of the token but also provide a reliable return for token holders. Equally as important is the increase in the inherent value of the token due to the capital appreciation of the property and reinvestment of capital.

​

02
INVESTORS 
The project will purchase and subsequently develop and/or let residential and commercial real estate. This income will be used to provide bonuses on a six-monthly basis for token holders and act as a source of continuous cash flow for future investments, as well as enable the project to benefit from the capital appreciation of the assets held.

​

In essence, TRUST is a property investment portal for the digital age, run for the benefit of the projects supporters (token holders) and not large commercial institutions.

03
DECENTRALISED
Currently, banks dictate the terms of buying real estate through the use of mortgage products. ​

​

Buy to Let mortgages often require a large deposit and fees for the investor purchasing the property, with the costs being passed onto the consumer in the form of high rental fees.

​

TRUST aims to decentralise the housing market by purchasing real estate outright and offering affordable rental fees to the consumer. 

​

TRUST itself is decentralised as 100% of the token supply will be held buy token holders following the four stages of distribution detailed in the whitepaper.
