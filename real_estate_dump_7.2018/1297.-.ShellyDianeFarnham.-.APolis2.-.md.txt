HackHousing Project

Living in a thriving community can be  an important component of personal/family well-being.  A thriving community is one where 
a) people know and regularly interact with each other, 
b) members have a sense of belonging that motivates them to help each other & the community,  
c) members are able to articulate their common goals, and 
d) members can work together to achieve those common goals.

When people are looking for places to live, what they lack in income, they can make up for by finding places with thriving communities.

This project explores how can we indicate based on open data that a neighborhood has a thriving community.  We build on a long history of research showing that thriving communities are more likely to grow when there are “third places” in a centralized location, where people are more likely to serendipitously interact.   By quantifying the number of third places in a neighborhood and their “hubbiness”, we can indirectly measure community.  Third places include:  bars, coffee shops, community centers, and so forth

Target user:
Low income or others experience life challenges warranting the need for more social support.
