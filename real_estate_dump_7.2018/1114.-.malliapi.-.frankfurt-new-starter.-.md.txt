### Transport

Tickets work for U-Bhan, S-Bahn, trams, buses, and possibly other public transport services. You can buy daily tickets using machines available at most S-Bhan and U-Bhan stations. And ticket machine can be changed to English, so no need to speak to ticket staff.

Single to Frankfurt from Eschborn Sud is €2.80, or €7 for an all day multiple journey ticket. 

To buy a monthly ticket, you can do so at the VGF/RMV office at Hauptewache. Monthly tickets cost €87.40, or €69.90 if buying a ticket you can only use after 9am. You should receive a plastic card, which you can then top up at ticket machines.

***Warning*** - If you do not have a valid ticket and get stopped by the ticket inspector it is an on the spot fine of 60 Euros. (You might be able to pull a fast one and say you are a tourist but you are on your own).

#### S-Bahn Light Rail
Station closest to the Office is Eschborn Sud, 5 minute walk away. This is the S-Bahn. It is a light rail train service. This runs frequently.  S4, S3, S5 run from Frankfurt to Eschborn Sud. Sud means South. Dont confuse this with Eschborn stop as it is further north. 

#### Buses
Bus tickets can be bought at ticket machines, so show ticket to driver and go.
Check maps for routes

#### Driving
The Germans drive on zee right.

#### Walking
Frankfurt is a walking friendly city, lots of pedestrian crossing points, similar to pelican crossing in the UK. Mind the Germans drive on zee right so look both ways. And if it is traffic light for pedestrians dont walk on red and the Germans stare at you defying the process, this is known as bean bagging the process. See process.

## Process
Germany loves its processes and is ruthlessly efficient at following them. Unfortunately this is not to be confused with ruthless process efficiency. Expect things to take a while ... like bank accounts.
