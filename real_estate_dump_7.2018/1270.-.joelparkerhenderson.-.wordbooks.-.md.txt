# Demo wordbooks

This repository contains demo wordbooks.

  * A wordbook is a collection of words, and possibly their meanings.
  * A wordbook is like a dictionary, glossary, lexicon, vocabulary, terminology list, etc.

We use these wordbooks with our software consulting clients.

  * A wordbook helps us communicate quickly, clearly, and consistently.
  * A wordbook is especially good for cross-cultural teams and global teams.
