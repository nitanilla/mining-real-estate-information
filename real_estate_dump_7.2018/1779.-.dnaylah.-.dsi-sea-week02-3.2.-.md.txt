## Introduction

- In this lab we will practice using the pivoting skills that we acquired in the last lesson.

#### Requirements

- Using this [rock song data](./assets/datasets/rock.csv), complete the following requirements:

    - Import pandas and numpy
    - Read in rock.csv as a data frame
    - The simplest pivot table must have a dataframe and an index . Letâ€™s use the ARTIST CLEAN as our index.
    - How about indexing on multiple values. Let's look at the data by ARTIST CLEAN and Release Year next.
    - Explicitly define the 'PlayCount' column by using the values field.

#### Starter code
- Use this [rock song starter code](./code/starter-code/w2-3.2-rock-starter.ipynb).

**Bonus:**
- After completing the rock song data, perform  all of the **same** requirements on this [real estate data](./assets/datasets/Sacramentorealestatetransactions.csv)!

- Note: Here is the [real estate starter code](./code/starter-code/w2-3.2-realestate-starter.ipynb).
