# Real Estate Price Prediction Through Machine Learning
This is a real world project to create a model for real estate price prediction with less than a specified error margin. 
This project is part of the Capstone project for Masterclass course. The requirement for this project was to build a stable and efficient model which can predict prices for real estate properties in a small town of New York state. To achieve the objective, Python supervised Machine Learning algorithms have been applied and the best model was chosen based on different metric scores.
All required permissions have been taken to use real-world data for the purpose of this project.
