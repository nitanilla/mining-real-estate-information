tampermonkey-jira-extended-rapidboard
=====================================

This is a Chrome Tampermonkey script to extend the JIRA Kanban Board so it allows a horizontal scrollbar for big number of columns. Here is how to install it:

1. If you have not done so install TamperMonkey Chrome plugin
2. Hit this url from Chrome: https://raw.github.com/nestoru/tampermonkey-jira-extended-rapidboard/master/tampermonkey-jira-extended-rapidboard.user.js
3. Accept the installation and hit your jira Website
4. Navigate to any JIRA Rapidboard page and you will get the horizontal scrollbar allowing you to have an extended number of columns without shrinking them. If you need more horizontal real estate for your columns then play with the "width" inside the script.



Why did I build this?
