3. population.xlsx

The last is for the local case study and comes from the Charlottesville Open Data Portal.

## Slides
The slides for this talk are in powerpoint format and zipped up here alonzi-presentation-novid.pptx.zip. One slide has been altered. It contained a video and that made it too large to upload to github so the video was removed.
