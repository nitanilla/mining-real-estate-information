# TV is stuck in the past
The channel numbers on your remote is real estate. The low channel slots are often auctioned away for big money. The buyers know that 0.1% of those who flip to the Jewelry Shopping Channel actually end up buying. They don't care if you - or the other 199,999 viewers are annoyed. This is classic spam, but in your living room instead of just your inbox. No wonder people are cutting their wires.  And the alternative - streaming - is not a lot better. You easily spend 30 minutes deciding on a movie or series to watch with the paradox of choice sitting next to you in the couch. And probably also the business of suggesting movies that have the lowest screening fees. You also never really know if your show is available on Hulu, Netflix, HBO Go or Amazon Prime. TV should not be hard work when you're trying to relax.

The one button remote
* Doesn't care one bit about networks and channel numbers.
* Ranking tv shows by their imdb score. Highest show gets the first channel slot
* A way to hack the tv industry by being 100% independent; no set top box, no partnerships. Just a really smart remote control that is connected to the cloud (IP) in one end and the tv (IR) in the other.
