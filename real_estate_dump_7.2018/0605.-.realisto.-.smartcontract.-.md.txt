# REALISTO ICO smart contract

## Goals

The REA Token works as an entry to the upcoming Realisto real estate investment platform. A part (10%) of the funds raised in the ICO will be used for completing the final stage of the platform development while the rest (90%) will be used for initial investments in real estate market.

## Terms

The ICO campaign will last 5 weeks. The first week is a "pre-sale" week. During the presale we want to attract larger-than-average investors by offering a solid bonus in exchange for a minimal contribution. The REA tokens are not transferrable during the ICO. Transfers will be enabled by us within one week after the ICO ends.

### Token price structure

The base rate of the REA token is set to 300 REA per 1 ETH.

Addditionaly bonuses apply according to the following scheme

| Phase |	Duration | Bonus % | Minimal contribution | REA/ETH |
| ----- | --------- | ------- | -------------------- | ---- |
| Presale | 1 week or until 7647120 REA tokens are sold | +30% | 5 ETH | 390 |
| Bonus 1 | 1 week  | +15% | 0.1 ETH | 345 |
| Bonus 2 | 1 week  | +10% | 0.1 ETH | 330 |
| Bonus 3 | 1 week  | +5% | 0.1 ETH | 315 |
| Base | 1 week  | 0% | 0.1 ETH | 300 |

10% of the incomming ETH is immediately forwarded to our operational wallet to cover costs of ongoing development and marketing work.

90% are held in the ICO contract until ICO is over.

### Contribution

Contributions from token exchange wallets, MultiSig wallets and other smart contracts are not supported. 

The address sending ETH to the Crowdsale contract will receive the REA tokens.
The REA tokens are not transferrable during the ICO. Transfers will be enabled by us within one week after the ICO ends.

We also offer the possibility to contribute by sending BTC to a unique (per contribution) bitcoin address. We have a payment processing system that can generate BTC contribution addresses on demand, track payments and trigger REA token generation via corresponding functionality of the Crowdsale contract. All operations are logged to ensure transparency. Note that an Ethereum Wallet is required in any case. 

### Token Generation

Tokens are generated as ETH comes in. There is no limit for the total amount of tokens that can be generated during ICO. 

After ICO ends we generate additional 
	- 10% of the sold tokens for the team
	- 3% of the sold tokens as reward for contributors in our Bounty Campaign.

After team and bounty tokens are generated the token is finalized i.e. generation is irreversibly disabled by the crowdsale contract.

### Team Tokens

Team tokens are stored in a vault contract which locks the tokens for one year.
