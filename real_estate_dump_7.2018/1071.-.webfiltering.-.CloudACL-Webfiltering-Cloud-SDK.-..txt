CloudACL Webfiltering Webservice SDK
===========
CloudACL Webfiltering Webservice is a webservice map any url, host, domain, ip address
to a category. The API is straightforward, the SDK contains sample code for Android,
iOS, Java and Python to consume it, but it is not a prerequisite to use the webservice.

Input
===========
The API definition is:

https://api.cloudacl.com/webapi/getcategory?uri=param1&key=param2

param1 is the url/host/domain/ip address you want to query, such as:
       yahoo.com, news.yahoo.com, http://news.yahoo.com,
       http://news.yahoo.com/top/, 206.190.61.106
param2 is the key you registered from cloudacl.com. If you don't
       currently have a key, please apply it from:
       http://www.cloudacl.com/profiles/developer/

Output
===========
The output is a JSON document. Here is one example:
{"errorcode":0,"id":55,"url":"yahoo.com","desc":"search-engine"}

errorcode:  0 success
           -1 uri is not found in CloudACL database
           -2 unexpected error
           -3 unknown key
           -4 malformed uri

id:         category id, see Category Mapping section

url:        The url hit in the database, it is not necessarily the
            same as the param1. For example, if user query news.yahoo.com
            CloudACL does not contain entry for new.yahoo.com, however,
            there is one entry for yahoo.com, CloudACL will return the category
            for yahoo.com instead. Here the url field s the actual entry in
            the database

desc:       If success (errorcode==0), desc is text to describe the category,
            the same as if you do a lookup in the Category Mapping with the id
            If fail (errorcode!=0), desc contains the error message
