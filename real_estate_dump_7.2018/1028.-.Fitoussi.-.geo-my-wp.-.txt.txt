- Compatible with WordPress version 3.8.3
- Modify the way GEO my WP geocodes an address when form is being submitted - Switched back from using JavaScript to XML. The geocode function had been improved to cache results. Means that when the same address is entered it will not be geocoded again but will be used from cached when available. Geocoded results are being cached for 3 months. This will results in faster page load and less API usage. The new geocode function can be found in the file geo-my-wp.php and can be used and called as GEO_my_WP::geocoder( $address ). The old geocode function can be still found in the file geo-my-wp-geocode.php but will be removed in one of the next updates of the plugin. So please update any custom code you might have which uses the old geocode function.

This is a major update with many bug fixs, core modification and improvements, new features and more. Please make sure to backup your current version before updating to the new one. 
After updating you will need to go over the settings page and re-save your settings as well as the search forms as many things have changed.

**Please visit <a href="http://geomywp.com">www.geomywp.com</a> for more information before updating your plugin**
Below are some of the major changes in this version:

* Core modification - The code reduced drastically, It is much cleaner, performs better, many function are documented, the number of files and folders had been reduced and more organized.
* Admin - styling improved, better search forms page, tooltips and more...
* Search queries - The main search queries are now working directly with WordPress query (WP_query) and BuddyPress query ( BP_User_Query) which should be better for performance and will be much easier to modify the plugin to work with every theme. Now you can simply copy and paste the WordPress posts loop from the theme that you are using into the result.php page of the plugin in order to have the results page matching you theme.
* Stand alone search form -  the search form moved into its own template file, just like the results theme. Now you can have full control on the look and functionality of the search form and the results.
* Improved widgets and shortcodes.
* Warnings removed.

* Per page value - using a drop down box you ( or the users of your site ) can now change the "per page" value live when viewing the results .
* There is no more use for the "form_only" attribute when using gmw shortcode. In order to have the results showing in a different page you will have to select the results page in the shortcode setting.
* localization - GEO my WP is now ready to be translated. There are no translated files ready yet but a default PO file is in geo-my-wp/languages. the plugin is also ready to be used with right to left languages. Please, if any of you get to translate GEO my WP it will be much appreciated if you'll share the PO and mo files so others will be able to use it as well.
* There is no more use for the shortcode [gmw_friends_results]. [gmw_results] will now serve as a results page for both posts and BuddyPress members.
* Styling - I have modified and  removed most of the CSS styling from the plugin. So if you had any custom styling you will probably lose it and will have to adapt it again.
* Renamed Files and folders
* Shortcodes name changed from "wppl" to "gmw":
  	* main shortcode - [gmw]
	* results - [gmw_results]
	* current location - [gmw_current_location]

Now you can set the "Width" and "Height" of the maps to either pixels or percentage. in the "search form shortcodes" settings  and in the "single location" and "single member" shortcodes. for example: [gmw_single_location width="100%" height="200px"] .
