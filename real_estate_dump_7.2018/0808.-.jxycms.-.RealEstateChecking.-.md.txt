This is a Real Estate Checking Application built by .Net Core MVC

## Description

I perform some clean-up on the agency’s data before importing it, meaning that I can’t just
match the data “as-is”.

Let’s assume I have 3 agencies using this system, each with different property matching rules:

• Only The Best Real Estate! (AgencyCode: OTBRE)

Only The Best Real Estate! use a lot of punctuation in their property names and addresses. A
property is considered to be a match if both the property name and address match when
punctuation is excluded. For example, the property “*Super*-High! APARTMENTS (Sydney)”
located at “32 Sir John-Young Crescent, Sydney, NSW.” would be a match for a property called
“Super High Apartments, Sydney” located at “32 Sir John Young Crescent, Sydney NSW”.

• Location Real Estate (AgencyCode: LRE)

Location Real Estate are not really good at locating properties, and as a result their properties
will often appear to be up to 200 metres away from the actual location when placed on a map.
A property is considered to be a match if the agency code is the same and the property is within
200 metres or less of the actual property location. For the sake of simplicity, assume that 1
degree of latitude or longitude is equal to 111km.

• Contrary Real Estate (AgencyCode: CRE)

Contrary Real Estate like to have their property names backwards. A property is considered a
match if the names match when the words in the name of the property are reversed. For
example, a property with the name “Apartments Summit The” is a match for a property with the
name “The Summit Apartments”.
