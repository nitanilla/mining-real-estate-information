A Real Estate Agent Website I created in HTML 5, PHP and Bootsrap with some JS.

I created the IDX Search form to be transparent and mobile friendly.

The IDX search form currently posts to an IDX Broker demo account to pull in demo MLS listing.

The search form and website can easily be switched to an actual IDX Broker account of a Real Estate Agent who signs up for the IDX Broker service. This will allow their listings and other mls listing to be pulled into the website.

The Contact Form uses PHPMailer script. Simply enter your SMTP credentials into the message.php file and you are all set to receive emails.

The Phone Number on the website is a Twilio phone number listed in my account and runs through my call.xml file and Twilio API.
