## Notes ##

Bots == UI

Bots != AI

Chatbots are really just the presentational form on to any application; 
It just happens to be messaging based (voice or text).

Question ideas:
- Provide property details from a large database of information: “I’m looking for a property with at least a half-acre in Portland.”
- Answer general real estate questions: “I’m trying to find a low down payment loan.”
- Ask leading questions to create a prospect profile: “Are you thinking about a bigger house?”
- Answer company questions: “How can I save money selling my house?”
- Integrate with social media chatbots: “I want a house that looks like Taylor Swift’s childhood home.”


Domain:
- Open Messenger and start a chat with Domain. Drop a pin of your current location or type in “Price of [Address]”.

The bot is accessed by simply typing Domain into the the Messenger app. Agents or house hunters then type in a specific address or drop a location pin in a set area and then instantly receive listing information for that area or address.

if a specific address is not listed for sale, the bot will utilise Domain’s Home Price Guide to provide an estimated price, previous listing photos and a sales and rental history summary.
