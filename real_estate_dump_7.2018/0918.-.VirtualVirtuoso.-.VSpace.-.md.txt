# VSpace
VSpace is a web application which allows real estate dealers to quickly create a floorplan of a given space. Through the use of Virtual Reality, this floorplan can then be sent to a potential client, who can use this visualisation to get an intuitive feel for the size of the space. This is useful in the early sale stage where a client might not want to commit to travelling to the site, before they have an idea for the feel for the site.

VSpace runs on the Google Cardboard platform, meaning that clients only need a Â£5 carboard headset in order to be able to experience the virtual reality.
