# Salesforce Integration Patterns and Practices

Apex REST Callouts, Apex SOAP Callouts, Apex Web Services

* Web service callouts to SOAP web services use XML, and typically require a WSDL.
* HTTP callouts to services typically use REST with JSON.

## Microservices
* Microservices is a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. 
* In a microservices architecture, services should be fine-grained and the protocols should be lightweight. The benefit of decomposing an application into different smaller services is that it improves modularity and makes the application easier to understand, develop and test. 
* It also parallelizes development by enabling small autonomous teams to develop, deploy and scale their respective services independently. 
* It also allows the architecture of an individual service to emerge through continuous refactoring.[2] Microservices-based architectures enable continuous delivery and deployment.

## Heroku & Salesforce Integration
### <i>Integration Through Data Replication</i>
Data replication is copying or synchronizing data between Salesforce and another system. You can use data replication for data warehousing to enable cross-data source reporting and analysis. You can also use it to work with legacy systems that either need data from Salesforce or feed data into Salesforce. The most common use case with Heroku and Salesforce is to provide a high-throughput, low-latency interface for customer-facing applications built with open-source technologies.
### <i>Integration Through Data Proxies</i>
Data proxies aggregate different datastores, but unlike data replication, the data isn't copied. The data can be read only on demand. This approach enables data science, business intelligence, reporting, and dashboarding tools to collate data across multiple datastores without worrying about data synchronization challenges like storage and staleness. You can integrate legacy systems and external systems through data proxies to provide data to Salesforce, or Salesforce can provide its data to other external systems.
### <i>Integration Through Custom User Interfaces</i>
When interfaces are built with open-source technologies like Java, Node.js, PHP, and so on, they can run on Heroku and be integrated into the Salesforce UI or just with Salesforce data. Other times, a legacy or external system provides a user interface that needs to be surfaced in the Salesforce UI.
### <i>Integration Through External Processes</i>
External processes can offload batch processing or workflow and trigger event handling to apps on Heroku. This method can be helpful depending on the type of job that needs to be done and the amount of effort involved. Data science, machine learning, image and video processing, and integration with legacy or external systems can be reasons to offload external processes to Heroku.

As an example, let's say your real estate company uploads photos for each house it lists for sale. These photos are huge, so you need a way to resize them to reduce loading times and storage costs. You can easily offload this job to an external process on Heroku. Each time a photo is uploaded to Salesforce, it is sent to an app on Heroku for processing, and the resized image is saved back into Salesforce. The app on Heroku that handles the external process could be responsible only for that one piece of the system. In that case, the app is likely considered a microservice that can be deployed separately without any other system dependencies.

* Heroku Connect
* Salesforce Connect
* Salesforce REST APIs
* Callouts
* Canvas

## Apex REST Callouts

* GET - obtain resource from the server.
* PUT - Create or replace the resource sent in the request body.
* URI - the endpoint address at which the service is located.
* JSONParser class converst it to an object.
* Apex test methods do not support callouts, the testing runtime allows to 'mock' the callout.
* To test the callouts, use mock callouts by either implementing an interface or using static resources.  When using the mock callout, the request is not sent to the endpoint.  Instead, the Apex runtime knows to look up the response specified in the static resource and returns it instead.

```Apex
Http http = new Http();
HttpRequest request = new HttpRequest();
request.setEndpoint('https://th-apex-http-callout.herokuapp.com/animals');
request.setMethod('GET');
HttpResponse response = http.send(request);
// If the request is successful, parse the JSON response.
if (response.getStatusCode() == 200) {
    // Deserialize the JSON string into collections of primitive data types.
    Map<String, Object> results = (Map<String, Object>) JSON.deserializeUntyped(response.getBody());
    // Cast the values in the 'animals' key as a list
    List<Object> animals = (List<Object>) results.get('animals');
    System.debug('Received the following animals:');
    for (Object animal: animals) {
        System.debug(animal);
    }
}
```

```Apex
Http http = new Http();
HttpRequest request = new HttpRequest();
request.setEndpoint('');
request.setMethod('POST');
request.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json;charset=UTF-8');
// Set the body as a JSON object
request.setBody('{"name":"mighty moose"}');
HttpResponse response = http.send(request);
if (response.getStatusCode() != 201) {
    System.debug('The status code returned was not expected: 
' + 
        response.getStatusCode() + ' ' +
 response.getStatus());
} else {
    System.debug(response.getBody());
}
```

```Apex
public class AnimalCallouts {

    public static HttpResponse makeGetCallout() {
        Http http = new Http();
        HttpRequest request = new HttpRequest();
        request.setEndpoint('');
        request.setMethod('GET');
        HttpResponse response = http.send(request);
        // if the request is successful, parse the JSON resposne.
        if (response.getStatusCode() == 200) {
            // Deserializes the JSON string into collections of primitive data types.
            Map<String, Object> results = (Map<String, Object>) JSON.deserializeUntyped(response.getBody());
            // Cast the values in the 'animals' key as a list 
            List<Object> animals = (List<Object>) results.get('animals');
            System.debug('Received the following animals:');
            for (Object animal: animals) {
                System.debug(animal);
            }
         }
         return response:
    }
     
    public static HttpResponse makePostCallout() {
        Http http = new Http();
        HttpRequest request = new HttpRequest();
        request.setEndpoint('');
        request.setMethod('POST');
        request.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json;charset=UTF-8');
        request.setBody('{"name":"mighty moose"}');
        HttpResponse response = http.send(request);
        // Parse the JSON response
        if (response.getStatusCode() != 201) {
            System.debug('The status code returned was not expected: ' +
                response.getStatusCode() + ' ' + response.getStatus());
            } else {
                System.debug(response.getBody());
            }
            return response;
         }
   } 
```

### Test a Callout with StaticResourceMock

```Apex
@isTest
private class AnimalsCalloutsTest {

    @isTest static void testGetCalloutsTest() {
        // Create the mock response based on a static resource
        StaticResourceCalloutMock mock = new StaticResourceCalloutMock();
        mock.setStaticResource('GetAnimalResource');
        mock.setStatusCode(200);
        mock.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json;charset=UTF-8');
        // Associate the callout with a mock response
        Test.setMock(HttpCalloutMock.class, mock);
        // Call method to test
        HttpResponse result = AnimalsCallouts.makeGetCallout();
        // Verify mock response is not null
        System.assertNotEquals(null, result, 'The callout returned a null response.');
        // Verify status code
        System.assertEquals(200,result.getStatusCode(), 'The status code is not 200.');
        // Verify content type
        System.assertEquals('application/json;charset=UTF-8',
            result.getHeader('Content-Type'),
            'The content value is not expected.');
        // Verify the array contains 3 items
        Map<String, Object> results = (Map<String, Object>)
            JSON.deserializeUntyped(result.getBody());
        List<Object> animals = (List<Object>) results.get('animals');
        System.assertEquals(3, animals.size(),
            'The array should only contain 3 items.');
        }
}
```
### Test a Callout with HttpCalloutMock

Test a POST callout.

Test class instructs the Apex runtime to send this fake response by calling Test.setMock.  For the first argument, pass HttpCalloutMock.class.  For the second argument, pass a new instance of AnimalsHttpCalloutMock, which is the interface implementation of HttpCalloutMock.
```Apex
Test.setMock(HttpCalloutMock.class, new
AnimalsHttpCalloutMock());
```

Add the class that implements the HttpCalloutMock interface to intercept the callout.  

```Apex
@isTest
global class AnimalsHttpCalloutMock implements HttpCalloutMock {
    
    // Implement this interface method
    global HTTPResponse respond(HTTPRequest request) {
        // Create a fake response
        HttpResponse response = new HttpResponse();
        response.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
        response.setBody('{"animals":"majestic badger"}');
        response.setStatusCode(200);
        return response;
     }
}
```

``` Apex
@isTest static void testPostCallout() {
    
    // Set mock callout class
    Test.setMock(HttpCalloutMock.class, new AnimalsHttpCalloutMock());
    // This causes a fake response to be sent from the class that implements HttpCalloutMock.
    HttpResponse response = AnimalsCallouts.makePostCallout();
    // Verify that the response contains fake values.
    String contentType = response.getHeader('Content-Type');
    System.assert(contentType == 'application/json');
    String actualValue = response.getBody();
    System.debug(response.getBody());
    String expectedValue = '{"animals":"majestic badger"}';
    System.assertEquals(actualValue, expectedValue);
    System.assertEquals(200,response.getStatusCode());
}
```

When making a callout from a method, the method waits for the external service to send back the callout response before executing subsequent lines of code. Alternatively, you can place the callout code in an asynchronous method that’s annotated with @future(callout=true) or use Queueable Apex. This way, the callout runs on a separate thread, and the execution of the calling method isn’t blocked.

When making a callout from a trigger, the callout must not block the trigger process while waiting for the response. For the trigger to be able to make a callout, the method containing the callout code must be annotated with @future(callout=true) to run in a separate thread.

## Pattern Selection Guide

| **Pattern**       | **Scenario**          |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| *Remote Process Invocation - Request and Reply*    | Salesforce invokes a process on a remote system, waits for completion of that process, and then tracks state based on the response from the remote system. |
| *Remote Process Invocation - Fire and Forget*  |  Salesforce invokes a process in a remote system but does not wait for completion of a process.  Instead, the remote process receives and acknowledges the request and then hands off control back to Salaeforce |
| *Batch Data Synchronization* | Data stored in Force.com should be created or refreshed to reflect updates from an external system, and when changes from Force.com should be sent to an external system.  Updates in either direction are done in batch manner.      |
| *Remote Call-In* | Data stored in Force.com is created, retrieved, updated, or deleted by a remote system. |
| *UI Update Based on Data Changes* | The Salesforce user interface must be automatically updated as a result of changes to Salesforce data. |
