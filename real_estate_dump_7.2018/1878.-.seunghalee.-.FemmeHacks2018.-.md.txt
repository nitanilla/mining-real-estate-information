# DocuHouse
All of your real estate documentation in one place.

## Inspiration
One of our teammates is buying her second house and is buried in various emails, miscommunications, and scattered deadlines across many different parties (agents, loan officers, escrow companies, etc.).

## What it does
We developed a simple documentation repository to bring together all documentation in one place. No more looking up emails. You can comment on uploaded documents, set deadlines in a calendar, edit and share task lists/deadlines, and chat live with your real estate agent/loan officer.

## Built With
`HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`
