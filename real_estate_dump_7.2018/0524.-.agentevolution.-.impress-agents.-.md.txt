Employee Directory tailored for Real Estate Offices.

## Description ##

IMPress Agents provides you with a full employee directory, however it is ideal for Real Estate offices.

This plugin adds a custom post type for Employees with post meta fields for employee contact info. It uses included templates to display the contact info for single and archive pages, or these can be overridden in your theme.

Adds taxonomies for Offices and Job Types to show employees by location and/or job title. Or add custom taxonmies to categorize to your needs. If using WP 4.4+, you can add images to taxonomy terms and display an image for an office, job title, or an custom taxonomy term.

If using the [IMPress Listings](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-listings/) plugin, you can connect Employees to Listings. *Requires the [Posts 2 Posts](https://wordpress.org/plugins/posts-to-posts/) plugin*

*Coming soon: Import agent details from the IDX API. Add more details and have them connected to imported listings from your [IDX Broker](http://www.idxbroker.com/) account!*
*Coming soon: Add your favorite vendors!*
