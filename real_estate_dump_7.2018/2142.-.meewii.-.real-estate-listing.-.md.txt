# Building a simple Android App for displaying real estate listings #

### Task 1 ###

Create an Android App that displays a list of real estate items. As a data provider use the following REST-API endpoint https://private-e618e0-mobiletask2.apiary-mock.com/realestates. The API documentation is available under http://docs.mobiletask2.apiary.io .

Each item should contain: The first image of the real estate, the title, the price and the address. The following Sketch shows the information that should be available on the screen. But feel free to layout the elements the way you prefer.


### Task 2 ###

Each real estate item could have more than one image. User should be able to see all of them. Please extend your App to support this feature

### Task 3 - choose one of the following ###

**Option 1:**
We want to embed advertisement in the resultlist. The advertisement must be displayed at every third position in the list. You can use a static image of your choice as advertisment.

**Option 2:**
To give users a better overview about the existing real estates, a map should be integrated in the screen. The map should display all items available. Please extend the app to support this feature.

### Remarks ###
* Implement the app in the best way that represents your understanding of high quality software
* While this is a small program, we will use this app to examine your knowledge of software architecture. Your app should be developed with this in mind.
* Provide the app as a Zip-File of the project including everything needed to compile and run the app
* The app will be compiled and run under Android 6.0 using Android Studio
* Please use only standard Android/Java code
* There are no restrictions regarding third party libraries
