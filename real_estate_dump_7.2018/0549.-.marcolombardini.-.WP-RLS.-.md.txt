##WP-RLS: Real Estate Listings Syndicator   

Forget about re-entering listing information by hand. Now seamlessly connect to the listings databases of the biggest real estate aggregators such as Zillow, Trulia, PadMapper and update your listings effortlessly.       
##Description     
This plugin creates an XML File so real estate professionals can syndicate listings from a WordPress powered website.   

To see the feed in action go to yoursite.com/?feed=zillow (Currently supports Zillow, HotPads, Padlister & Streeteasy)

The current version only supports one specific theme but can be easily customized to work with any WordPress template or theme that has real estate listings.
