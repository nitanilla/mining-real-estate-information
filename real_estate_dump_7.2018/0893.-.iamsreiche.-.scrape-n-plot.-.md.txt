scrape-n-plot!
============

**Scrape-n-plot** is a collection of three independent python programs.
 - a web scraper to collect data from a real estate platform
 - a script that normalizes the data to make it representable
 - a program that visualizes the data using Matplotlib and a shapefile of Berlin

>**Note:**
Since I'm not sure if the owners of the site this scraper is designed for are okay with me publishing the code for a tool to collect data from their service, I decided to save the URL in a separate config-file. This file is not tracked in this repository.
