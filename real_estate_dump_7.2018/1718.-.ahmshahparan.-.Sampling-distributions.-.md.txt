# Foundations-for-statistical-inference

In this lab, we investigate the ways in which the statistics from a random sample of data can serve as point estimates for population parameters. We're interested in formulating a sampling distribution of our estimate in order to learn about the properties of the estimate, such as its distribution.

We consider real estate data from the city of Ames, Iowa. The details of every real estate transaction in Ames is recorded by the City Assessor's office. Our particular focus for this lab will be all residential home sales in Ames between 2006 and 2010. This collection represents our population of interest. In this lab we would like to learn about these home sales by taking smaller samples from the full population. Let's load the data.
