# Simulation tools for real estate investment

## Motivation

When thinking about buying an appartment, I faced many questions:
- how much the loan is going to cost ?
- what might be the impact of an inflation/deflation ?
- what would be the effect of the evolution of the prices of real estate properties ?
- what would happen if I want to reimburse quicker a loan ?
- what would be the long term difference between investing my money compared to buying a place ?
- how can we estimate a life annuity ?

So I started building spreadsheets and testing all sorts of scenarios. In the end, it got a bit messy and gave me the idea of starting this project.
And if it helps me, it might as well help others !
