# Real_Estate_neuralnet
[Work in progress] Kaggle's Real Estate competition using neural networks

It is difficult to fit the neural network in this problem, but it was a good exercise.
The network is extremely sensitive to the scaling function and perhaps part of theissue lies therein. 
However, the choice of the activation function plays a crucial role too. 

I have the feeling the network (at least for some of the cases tried) overfits the model on the training set. The test set, being slightly different, does not allow to get decent predictions.

Still... not at the VERY bottom in the Kaggle ranking, which is good enough for now :)
