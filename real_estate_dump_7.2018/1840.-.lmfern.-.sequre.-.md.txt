# sequre
This is a project I worked on to build a a minimum viable product for the Real Estate and Escrow industries. Sequre allows for the safe exchange of information and documents in the real estate closing process. Implemented using the MERN stack (MongoDb, ExpressJS, ReactJS and Node.js), allowing escrow agents to open, invite involved parties to access the escrow information they need, based on their role in the transaction.  

The code posted here pertains to the messaging system and payments and subscriptions functionality which I worked on.  

Note: these are not executable files.
