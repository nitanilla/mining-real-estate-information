A React app that finds, for a given pair of addresses within Austin, TX, the nearby real estate agencies with the least combined distance to those addresses.

##### The following were on my to-do list but didn't quite happen in time:


* **An actual map displaying the locations of each agency**

* **A nice UI**

* **Ability to add more fields and search by more than two addresses**
  * I actually put a reasonable amount of effort into optimizing and DRYing up
    the code with this, among other things, in mind, so I might go back and do this.

* **Links to each real estate agency's website, or to the official Google one for that agency.**
  * These are available via a Google Places "Details" request, but hitting the API for
  that many detail requests was locking me out.
    * My attempted, fairly silly, solution was to simply cache as many detail
      results as possible by scraping the API in advance with a separate script, but,
      while the scraping worked, it turned out what I had scraped was insignificant
      compared to the total number of real estate agencies in Austin, so it made
      little difference. It would still work, but I would have to start with a much
      larger set of search coordinates than I initially tried.

* **Better, non-blocking solution for integrating Google Maps**
  * I currently have a pretty gross hack using window.requestAnimationFrame to simply delay
  loading any React components until we are sure they will have access to google maps and won't
  crash as soon as their class is defined.

* **Loading indicators, rather than nothingness and then "suddenly -- data!"**
  * Goes with "Nice UI," above
