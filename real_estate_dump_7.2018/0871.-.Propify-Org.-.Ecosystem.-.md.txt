# A Word From the MD
Realizing the importance of embracing new technology is as important in any business as controlling the company budget. Kodak was once the powerhouse of photography, you could not think about photography without thinking Kodak. The advent of new technologies like digital cameras and their integration into nearly all devices like iPhone’s, computers and tablets meant that printing photos was something that was just not needed as much. The industry lost many large and innovative companies like Agfa, Konica & Polaroid to name a few. One company survived the photographic disruption, Fuji. I always think, what did Fuji do right that the others didn’t. And the answer is change. They adopted new technology and changed their business structure.

So what of the real estate industry? In the late 1990’s, the advent of the Internet meant property was now more accessible than ever. If you were interested in buying a new house or investment property, you could enter where you wanted to buy, how many bedrooms, bathrooms & garages and be delivered to a list of properties for sale in that respective area. You didn’t even need to be in the same suburb or town or buy a newspaper to see what was for sale, as you once did. As lame as this may now seem, it was a big deal back in the 1990’s.

Where has the real estate industry come since? The answer is not far. For the past 20 years, not much as changed on the real estate publishing front. Real estate agents still list their properties for sale and publish them on real estate websites. Consumers visit the respective property websites and are exposed to listings in their relevant search field. The same search functionality that existed in 1999 still exists today.

Consumers have changed and the real estate industry has not.

Enter Propify. We have revolutionized the real estate marketing process so that consumers can find exactly what they are interested in and looking for. No more redundant and tired suburb/bed/bath searches. Propify employs social media style hash tags and follows, where the Propify algorithm recognizes what consumers like. Realtors can easily promote their successes and properties for sale, interact with like minded peers and more intimately connect with the consumer.

The world has changed.

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Propify - a decentralized, social media real estate platform.

Online real estate search has not changed in functionality since its inception of the late 1990’s. The term Property Portal was coined and became a synonymous 90’s buzzword, where companies were founded like Zillow, Trulia, Realtor.com and realestate.com.au, which are today worth of up to $6 Billion.

20 years on, consumers have become more confident in their online experiences, seeking more transparent and socially focused platforms, spawning new advanced technologies including Google, Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin and newer tech such as Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum & others. Realizing the shift in consumer behavior and new intelligent technologies of smart contracts, Propify has crafted a social media platform, specific for real estate, based on Blockchain distributed technology with enhanced consumer interaction and realtor/agency validation & qualification.

As the database technology NoSQL is “Not SQL”, Propify is not a Property Portal (No-Portal). Propify publishes property listings via an ecosystem of products & services, utilizing social media search algorithms and Blockchain distributed technology.

With the Propify No-Portal ecosystem, consumers are able to confidentially find the property they are looking for in a more transparent and secure real estate marketing process. Real estate agents will experience a much more efficient and cost effective marketing solution with direct consumer access.

Propify revolutionizes the online property marketing process, delivering a secure, state of the art platform that surpasses any property marketing technology of today. The team behind Propify are veteran leaders of real estate, property marketing, Blockchain and Fintech.

# Social Media Platform for Real Estate, Built on the Blockchain
PROPIFY REPRESENTS THE CONVERGENCE OF THREE TECHNOLOGIES, SOCIAL MEDIA, ONLINE REAL ESTATE AND BLOCKCHAIN, INTO A SINGULAR PROPERTY MARKETING ECOSYSTEM. EACH TECHNOLOGY IS DEPENDANT ON THE NEXT, COMPLIMENTING THEIR RELEVANT STRENGTHS AND THUS MITIGATING FLAWS WITHIN THEIR SINGULAR ENVIRONMENTS.

Social media has proven to be an extremely lucrative technology for consumers and organizations to interact and communicate more effectively. It is no surprise that social media attracts advertisers spending an estimated $35 billion per year in 2017.

Online publishing of real estate has seen two decades of success, receiving global consumer support via real estate classified websites (aka property portal) such as Zillow, Zoopla, realestate.com.au, magicbricks, rightmoveco.uk, Juwai, Trulia, 99acres, myplace.co.nz, Green-acres and Seloger to name a few.

Blockchain has proved itself as a solid framework & secure protocol, offering an immutable and confident solution to ensure the safe transfer of data from one solution to another.

# SOCIAL MEDIA & THE ATTENTION ECONOMY
Social media is typically described as:
• A network of social interactions, personal relationships and things.
• A dedicated website or other application which enables users to communicate with each other by posting information, comments, messages, images, etc.
• A specially designed online platform that brings together ideas from diverse sources in a social & community focused way.
There are many versions of social media platforms which specialize in many areas, examples are:

Reddit
Instagram
YouTube
Facebook
Google+
WhatsApp
Twitter
Medium
FourSquare
Linkedin
Slack
Quora
Snapchat
Pinterest
Tumblr
Flickr
Kik
Tinder

The above comprehensive list spans most (if not all) of the social media sphere, however, none specialize in the lucrative real estate, property or home renovation sectors.

Social media provides the ability for the real estate industry to connect with potential consumers and like-minded real estate peers. A real estate social media focused platform will help the real estate industry facilitate:
• Building Reputation – connect and involve consumers more effectively, promoting business & personal reputation.
• Extensive Network – Build an intimate network of followers, property focused of which are more likely to connect and employ services.
• Diversity in Marketing Efforts – Cost effective, targeted marketing. Focus marketing efforts on a diverse range of products, targeting the specific property audience.
• Ease of Search – consumers are more easily able to find the ideal property &/or real estate professionals by employing social media search practices such as follows & hash tags.

# Social Media Users
9.5 of every 10 property buyers research real estate online first, before buying or selling property; where, 70% are female.

# PROPERTY PORTALS
A property portal (real estate classified website) is defined as:
• A property search gateway that aggregates data about properties for sale by real estate agents.
• A specially designed property website that brings together properties for sale, lease and sold from diverse sources in a uniform way.

A property portal’s main aim is to publish properties online, which can be searched and viewed at a designated web address. They were first developed to save a property consumer time, in comparison to newspaper and other paper based advertisements.

Since their first inception, Property Portals have expanded to provide additional information such as size, price or rent, location, proximity to amenities and facilities like railway stations, airports, schools, parks, hospitals and parks.

# HOW DO PROPERTY PORTALS MONETIZE THEIR SERVICES?
In 2016, property advertising in the US attracted $13.6 Billion for the year, where $10.4 Billion was purely dedicated to online spend. That is 76% of all real estate advertising dollars devoted to online.

Property portals make up much of the Realtors online marketing budget, charging for listing fees and services such as:
• Monthly/annual site subscription fees
• Depth products, such as premium listing placement and listing highlights
• Lead generation & conversion services
• Agency branding & other solutions
• On selling user data
• Per listing fees

In addition to the above mentioned feeds, property portals receive additional income via banner advertisements, dramatically increasing possible revenues via opening their platform for other industries to advertise and target consumers, such industries as mortgage broking, escrow, home DIY, insurance and many other.

Typically, advertising rates on property portals vary depending on the page content, visit strength and relevance. At a high level, the following banner advertising styles are usual on most property portals:
• Top banner - leaderboard
• Side banner - skyscraper
• In listings banner – strip ad
• Side listing square – medium rectangle

In addition to the above, many property portals provide advertising products such as blog advertising, map skyscraper, direct mail and carousels.

# Blockchain, Smart Contracts & Cryptocurrency
A Blockchain is referred to as a rapidly increasing list of chronological & lineal records known as “blocks”, which are connected and secured through the use of cryptography. In a typical Blockchain, dedicated blocks are used to store transaction data, timestamps and other items such as a hash pointer as a link to a previous block, a timestamp and transaction data, thus creating the Blockchain.

Blockchains are highly secure by nature and design and referred to as immutable, meaning they cannot be changed or does not change over time. As such, Blockchains are perfect to record private and secure items such as medical records, transaction processing, identity management, food traceability and documenting other processes requiring advanced security. As such, Blockchain technology has the greatest potential towards transforming the property marketing process to ensure properties marketed are true, accurate and belong to the correct advertiser.

# SMART CONTRACTS
Smart contracts are self-executing digital contracts, written in a specific code, with the goal of exchanging an items value in real time. They are also known as Blockchain contracts, self-executing contracts and digital contracts.

Smart contracts employ Blockchain technology as a decentralized ledger where each of the contracts are stored in a replicated system and assist with the exchange of value in a conflict-free, transparent approach and without the use of intermediaries.

In real estate, smart contracts can assist with the exchange of a properties title or deed from one entity to another. Smart contracts can also help streamline the property listing process for real estate agencies.

Propify employs smart contracts to list real estate on its own Blockchain to ensure integrity and a faster, more secure transaction of listing a property.

# CRYPTOCURRENCY
Cryptocurrencies are a digital medium of exchange that employs the use of highly secure cryptography. Cryptocurrency is made possible with the use of Blockchain technology, where all transactions are recorded against a public registry and, with the use of smart contracts, can transact instantaneously or at a set point in time.

Bitcoin became the first Cryptocurrency in 2009, and since its inception, many forms of Cryptocurrencies have emerged such as Ethereum.

Known as digital gold, Cryptocurrencies are a much faster means of making worldwide, instantaneous payments, and due to their private, transparent & cryptographic nature, they remain highly secure modes of payment. As such, Cryptocurrencies are accepted by institutions and organizations globally and are the preferred payment of many new entities, ICO’s and crowd funding exercises.

# Ethereum
Ethereum is an open-source Cryptocurrency on a public distributed platform. Ethereum is the second largest Cryptocurrency by market cap and is the preferred currency for community fund raising projects.

The Ethereum Cryptocurrency coin is known as the “ether”, which is the value token of the Ethereum Blockchain. Its diminutive symbol is ETH and traded on several Cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Coinbase, CEX.io, Coinspot and many others, where they can be purchased and converted to other forms of Cryptocurrency or, vice versa, back to fiat.

# The Problem
Online real estate marketing has seldom changed over the past two decades, consumers are actively seeking a new approach to property consumption. Existing real estate & property marketing platforms have been slow to adapt to consumer expectations.
• Consumers cannot always find what they are looking for, or trust the information is accurate.
• A rapidly changing dynamic of the property consumer.
• Poor transparency across the property marketing process.
• Agents qualifications are not always certain.
• Validating an agent & agency is time consuming and prone to error.
• Real estate agents/agencies pay large fees to market property.
• Existing portals do not provide enough customer intimacy & access.

# The Solution
Propify has crafted a revolutionary property marketing solution that spans the complete ecosystem of online property marketing. Realizing the shift in property consumer behavior, Propify targets consumers in their natural and non-threatening online search habits.
• Create a social platform, specific for real estate that is underpinned by Blockchain and the Ethereum network.
• Provide transparency across the property marketing process and provide transparency of individual real estate agents & agencies.
• Provide an ecosystem of products and services to facilitate the safe and secure marketing of property, digitally and the secure communication between the consumer, agent and peers.
• Create a mechanism to validate agents & brokers.
• Deliver a more cost effective solution for the agent & vendor.
• Provide the platform & framework for future growth & expansion.

# Propify Ecosystem
A complete property ecosystem, underpinned by Blockchain with social media block explorers.

FOR TOO LONG PROPERTY HAS BEEN CONTROLLED BY A LIMITED FEW. PROPIFY PLACES VISIBILITY ACROSS THE COMPLETE TRANSACTION, AND IN TURN, HANDING OVER A DECENTRALIZED AUTONOMOUS SOLUTION TO THOSE THAT USE IT.

Propify converges multiple platforms as a unified solution to list, find & promote property. At its core, Propify offers a qualification solution to ensure property data is accurate and reliable. A social media driven block explorer provides the ability to search and locate property easily and an exchange publishes property via existing social media channels from the Blockchain, with qualified data.

The block explorer is a property focused, stand-alone social media application made available for IOS, Android & desktop devices.
Propify offers:
1. Multiple points of entry to list & promote property
2. Blockchain to qualify property data
3. Block explorer to discover properly data
4. Multiple consumer & property professional touch points
5. Social media optimization solutions

# Multiple Points of Entry
The ability for qualified property professionals to add and edit property related content, such as properties for sale, rent and sold via Propify’s custom listing solution or a direct feed to the Property ecosystem via the property professionals own listing solution.

# Blockchain
A solution to provide visibility across the property transaction process, recording the creator, seller, appraiser, and other relevant information.

# Block Explorer
An intuitive search platform, social media based, to find and locate properties, property transactions, appraisers and real estate agents.

# Consumer Touch points
Via the social framework, Propify promotes properties for sale, rent and sold via multiple platforms, spanning search engines & social media, creating the ability for the consumer to be exposed to property they desire.

# Social Media Optimization
Propify provides multiple solutions to increase a property listings relevance across social media & search engines. Property data is customized per platform to maximize the property & property professionals exposure.

# The Block Structure
The information stored within each of the blocks depends upon what the block is servicing. In relation to an actual property, the following items may be recorded:
• Time & hash stamps
• Creator detail
• The address of the property
• The property owner & details
• Relevant property attributes such as beds, baths, cars
• Market & real property value
• Sale, rent and other associated price

Each property block is associated to other relevant blocks, storing details such as the specific property professionals details & certifications and further blocks associated to property valuation, market and Government data may also be available.

Propify provides block explorers to find and locate relevant property and property professional information.
To ensure the accuracy of the blockchain, Qualis is used to ensure the ongoing quality of data recorded and shared.

# How it Works
For The Realtor
For real estate professionals seeking to extend their reach, become the leader, or to join the growing consumer search behavior shift, Propify provides an easy to use solution to list property, gain followers and interact with consumers & peers.
A realtor or agency may decide to enter listings directly into the Propify ecosystem, or they may decide to send directly from their dedicated management systems and bypass the Propify upload application.

Properties & real estate professionals are collated & qualified against Propify’s Blockchain where, once vetted for publishing, are made visible on consumer facing search platforms such as social media.

Listr, Propify’s own property social media platform, displays content that is qualified against Propify’s Blockchain, making property updates available for consumers to discover and interact with properties & real estate professionals.

Blocks from the Blockchain are displayed on the Listr platform in the form of updates, in chronological order, showcasing changes and alterations in real time. Users can sort via the use of hash tags and follows, where users can receive direct messages and or calls from consumers via an intuitive messaging App.

# For The Consumer
Today’s property buyers and sellers are being led by a new generation of technology advancements, role models and are searching for property from an entirely new approach. Propify’s consumer facing applications aid the property professional in connecting with consumers, in the manner they are seeking.

With Propify’s social media application Listr, consumers are able to find the exact property they are looking for and using hash-tags, consumers can better locate individual properties, locations, styles and/or professionals.

An easy to use messaging App. allows for consumers to connect directly to the real estate agent and agency, shortening the response time and increasing visibility.

Consumers may also discover Propify related content throughout their usual Internet usage habits, via strategically optimized advertisements and posts throughout existing social media channels and search engines.

# Qualis
Propify employs the use of two Blockchains called Qualis, that together qualify and vet properties and professionals such as real estate agents.

Qualis provides qualified and trusted data (property content) to publish on consumer facing platforms, where Propify’s own social media platform Listr publishes blocks as real time updates.

Qualis operates over a two main activities:
• The qualification of agents/agencies handling the property and;
• The property itself.

Data arrives at Qualis in many forms such as , direct feed from real estate agents, Government agencies, social media and directly entered property data via Propify’s property listing solution.
• Agent’s & Government Agencies Direct Feed
An API connection is available for real estate agents, agencies, brokers and Government agencies to supply property & agent contact data for listing in the Propify ecosystem. This is a direct and autonomous feed that is vetted by the Qualis qualification system.
• Social Media Feed
Via the social framework, Qualis scrubs property & real estate agent/broker data to vet for accuracy. Data that is not qualified is stored and available via the block explorer, labeled “unqualified”. Data that is qualified is published as accurate property data and available via the Propify block explorers.
• Propify Direct Entry
Once a Realtor is qualified and approved, Propify provides the ability for any real estate agent, agency, broker or property professional to create property data. All created property data is tagged and associated with the creators own block hash which is never altered. The creator represents the first transaction in the Blockchain.

# The Stack
Propify’s distributed technology stack is underpinned by Qualis, where qualified blocks are published to the Listr block explorer for discovery. Direct Propify content is optimized for social media publishing, whereby online brochure’s and video clips are autonomously rendered.

Social media content is curated from existing platforms via the social framework and in turn, added to Qualis and qualified against a public ledger for publishing for the accurate display of property data.

An intuitive, AI based consumer targeting application runs across the Propify ecosystem directing property consumers back to the promoter (the real estate agent or agency).

Propify also provides a marketing and lead capture solution, where property information is gathered and displayed singularly, on a per property basis that assembles generated property detail in one location, for that one listing with no competitors.

# Monetization
Propify is a social media platform and as such, it collects revenues per social media monetization models. The following services make the Propify business case:
• Premium Listings (updates), whereby all users are able to pay for the promotion of property listings per time, impression, behavioral, geographic and demographic targeting.
• Custom Branding & URL on selected listings across the ecosystem, including property brochure, video and social updates.
• Subscription for multiple listings, services and accounts.
In addition to the above immediate-term revenue model, future revenues will be made via planned product improvement and application development, to allow for revenue streams such as fees for Escrow services and Blockchain handling transactions.

# Expected Growth
Propify’s growth strategy is derived from solving the immediate property professional and consumer related issues surrounding the promotion and discovery of real estate online.

Growth is projected to be steady for the first 12 months of launch, where additional product improvements and marketing campaigns are expected to greatly raise Propify’s awareness and thus usage.

# Road Map
The Propify solution was first considered in 2014 and Propify the concept was finally developed in 2015, subsequently altered and improved.

In 2016, the social platform Listr, was developed and tested in California and commenced trials as a standalone product, separate to the Blockchain.

January 2017, the Propify framework was developed, comprising of individual product sets as additional income generating solutions per the monetization strategy.

Version 2 of the Propify ecosystem will be released Q4 2017 after a successful pre-contribution sale and Version 3 of the Propify ecosystem will commence early 2018 where a public block explorer will be added.

# The Future
Propify’s future is to expand its Blockchain offering beyond property marketing and offer a complete platform for the property transaction.

Beyond property marketing, Propify will improve the property listing and property transaction process by expanding its Blockchain framework to Government agencies and professional services such as Appraisers, Valuers, Conveyancer, Lawyers and Escrow to name a few.

The Propify platform is a 5-phase strategy over a 3 to 5 year LiveCycle, where Phase 1 & 2 are complete and Phase 3 is due for release Q2 2018.

# Phase 1 - Propify Stack
Release a full working model of the Propify marketing ecosystem. Test clients and improve on the process, streamlining efficiencies.

# Phase 2 - No-Portal Ecosystem
Develop a full working model of the No-Portal ecosystem, where by properties are marketed via social media and vetted against a listing & Realtor Blockchain.

# Phase 3 - Public Block Explorer
Deliver a full working version of the Propify Block Explorer for use by the public to find and resolve property & Realtors in the Blockchain.

# Phase 4 - Government Titles Platform
Working with Government agencies, provide a full working platform for Government use to vet, secure and ensure accurate property data for public interest.

# Phase 5 - Purchase Property Online
Provide a complete working framework to buy and sell property instantly online using the security of Blockchain, Smart Contracts & Cryptocurrencies.

# Token Sale - REAL ESTATE
The Propify token is based on the Ethereum network and named REAL ESTATE, where 100 REAL ESTATE tokens = 1 Ethereum.
5,000,000 REAL ESTATE tokens are available to be sold in the Pre-Contribution phase. The total Pre-Contribution tokens equate to 5% of the total tokens minted, where the remainder is reserved for the company and the ICO process that will occur after the Pre-Contribution phase.

The initial pre-contribution will commence on December 14, 2017, where the pre-contribution sale will end when the hard cap reached or the bonus cap is reached. For early contributors, a Token Holders Fund is formed from a set percentage of daily revenues. The fund is paid out to fund holders each quarter, based on the percentage of commitment.

A Pre-Contribution bonus offer of 25% applies to all pre-contributors contributing on day one of the token sale. The bonus diminishes over the course of the pre-contribution event. An additional bonus is applied to early contributors, purchasing more than 100 REAL ESTATE tokens.

# BONUS TABLE
First Day: 25% + 5% bonus when 100 or more REAL ESTATE Tokens purchased
Day 2 – 5: 20% + 4% bonus when 100 or more REAL ESTATE Tokens purchased
Day 6 – 10: 15% + 3% bonus when 100 or more REAL ESTATE Tokens purchased
Day 11 – 14: 10% + 2% bonus when 100 or more REAL ESTATE Tokens purchased
Day 15 - end: 5% + 1% bonus when 100 or more REAL ESTATE Tokens purchased

In the above example, purchasing 5,000 REAL ESTATE tokens on day ONE would equate a bonus of:
• 25% bonus = 1250 bonus REAL ESTATE tokens
• 5% bonus = 250 bonus REAL ESTATE tokens
Total tokens on day one would be 6,500 REAL ESTATE Tokens.

# Funds Allocation
The Pre-Contribution token sale is required to secure marketing and operational capital, of which will be used to recruit talent, implement and launch Propify. A development budget has been reserved to continually improve the application and increase the User Interface (UI).

No tokens are reserved for the Propify team. The pre-contribution token sale is solely intended for Propify’s success, whereby all funds raised are aimed to provide value to token holders, realtors and consumers.

A set allocation for legal & advisors is reserved to ensure external parties are properly remunerated for their services. All unused tokens will be returned to the company for redistribution. A 1% fee has been reserved for exchanges, where costs are attributed to the movement of tokens to and from the designated Ethereum and fiat.

As part of the company’s commitment for professional excellence and talent acquisition, a percentage of token sales is reserved for the Chris Vulovic Scholarship Foundation. The Foundation is tasked to find and secure talented individuals for employment with Propify and in turn, fund tertiary studies in technology and related fields.

# Pre-Contribution Collection Process
An Ethereum Wallet has been created to collect pre-contribution Ethereum. Funds to the Propify Ethereum wallet must be supplied by an ERC20 compatible wallet. This is required to ensure efficient and accurate disbursement of tokens to token holders.

At the purchase commencement, pre-contributors must enter their TX code into the pre-contribution form. This is an added security measure for reconciliation to ensure accurate payment of tokens to token holders and correct funds transfer.
After the ICO, contributors will receive their tokens. The process is expected to be no more than 30 days after the close of the ICO. Token holders will be provided the opportunity to be supplied their token allocation by the provided ERC20 wallet or reside within the token holders account on Propify.

# Token Holders Fund
The Token Holders Fund is an allocation of the companies revenues that are made available to token holders. The fund will disperse the allocation to registered token holders each quarter.

1% of the company revenues are allocated to the Token Holders Fund every day, where token holders receive a percentage of the fund in Ethereum, based on the token holders percentage contribution.
Purchasing 1% of the total available tokens will provide 1% return from the Token Holders Fund.

# The Chris Vulovic Scholarship Foundation
PROPIFY WILL DONATE A SET PERCENTAGE OF COMPANY REVENUES TO THE CHRIS VULOVIC SCHOLARSHIP FOUNDATION.
