Youtube Link Cleaner
====================

Simple Chrome extension that alters all Youtube links to link to the fullscreen ad-free version of the video rather than the standard Youtube portal view.

This is useful if you are not interested in seeing related videos, comments, wasted screen real-estate, and autoplay and would simply like to watch a youtube video in peace :).

As of right now it is functional, but in the future I think context-menu integration would be ideal, perhaps an option in the right-click menu to bypass the filter and view the video normally.
