# REAL-T 
## Real Estate Lending Tracker


### Background

This is a project using modern web technologies to recreate and reimagine a set of program modules I wrote years ago. At the time, I was a real estate attorney working for a local title company. I saw a problem and created a solution. I taught myself programming in object oriented visual basic to automate case file production and formatting for a portfolio of clients. The software was for the Microsoft Office platform and automated tasks across Word, Excel, and Outlook, creating documents, tasks, and emails, scheduling events, and aggregating information for analysis.

On my own time, and over the course of several months, I engineered a system that achieved a better than 50% reduction in the time required to prepare and manage case files, while improving accuracy. It was an exciting and deeply satisfying project for me because I used it every day in my professional work and it made such an improvement.

That experience played a major part in motivating my transformation to a career in software engineering and web development. This project is my work to recreate a modern full stack web version of the program that was the catalyst that led me here.

## Project Summary

This is a full stack project. On the front end I use **AngularJS, Angular Material, UI-Router, Sass, and Webpack**. The back end on the live version is currently (9/2/17) using Google's **Firebase** for database and user authentication, but I am building a back end with **Node.js, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, and Passport** - see the "mongo" branch of this repo for its current progress.

This web app is for real estate professionals, lawyers, or title companies, to manage real estate loans and non-judicial foreclosures. 

The main target features of the app are to:
* Store and display relevant information about the property, parties involved, and terms of the loans.
* Allow user entry and editing of new and existing case information.
* Generate the necessary legal documents with the case-specific data.  
* Automatically generate the schedule for mailing and publication, and the appropriate correspodence and emails for the applicable jurisdiction.
* Enable useful analytics of data pertaining to all aspects of the portfolio, including clients, properties, case progress, etc.

Not all of these have been fully implemented yet, but you can see an early version live here:
