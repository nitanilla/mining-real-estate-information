Java example on how to extract text from PDF using both Tika and PDFBox

## How to use it
Clone it and either load into your favorite IDE or use Maven directly.
After that, you can either provide a PDF file or a URL of a PDF as input. Take a look at the unit test which shows the latter approach.

To use this application with any other real estate PDF url, follow the procedure below.

## Examples of PDF from the Web
This application was created to read publicly available specific real estate PDFs containing properties sold in a given year in the state of Massachusetts, data provided by the [Middlesex North Registry of Deeds](http://www.lowelldeeds.com/sales.htm).

1. Choose a town and year for which you want to see properties sold.
2. Your browser will open that PDF automatically
3. Copy and paste the link into PdfExtractorMain class.

If you need help with this or incorporating Zillow web services into your web app, let me know.
 
Enjoy!
