# Desafio on Rails

I made this to see how cool Ruby on Rails is, and I liked it!

It's a Real Estate system prototype.

I know the layout is simple, but I focused on the funtionalities.

You can add and show properties and also add and show "real estate ads" (with images).

I used cloud9 as IDE, bootstrap and Heroku for deployment and host the database.
