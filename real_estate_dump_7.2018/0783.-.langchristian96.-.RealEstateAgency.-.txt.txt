    CONSOLE APPLICATION : Real Estate Agency
========================================================================
Evelyn owns a real estate agency. Being also the single employee,
she needs an application to help her manage all the real estates of
her clients. Each Offer has a type (can be house, apartment or
penthouse), an address, a surface and a price. Evelyn needs the
application to help her in the following ways:
a. The application must allow adding, deleting or updating a
real-estate. A real-estate is uniquely identified by its
address.
b. The application should offer the possibility to display all
offers whose address contains a given string (if the string is
empty, all offers will be considered), sorted ascending by their price.
c. Evelyn would like to be able to see all offers of a given type, having the surface greater than a
given value.
d. Unlimited Undo/Redo.
