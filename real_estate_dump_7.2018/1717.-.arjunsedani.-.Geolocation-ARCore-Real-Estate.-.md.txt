Geolocation-ARCore for real estate
The application serves as a base for any developer to build their own Geolocation AR app. The basic concept of the app is to help a user identify a certain building or location. When the user points their camera at a building, a 3D object like a wooden sign representing the direction and name of the building, is augmented onto their camera view. The user can view this object from any angle, interact with it by touching it for further information about the location.Now using this it can be further enhanced to for real estate purpose.Onclick of the sign board buyer can have 3d interactive view of the property.
The documentation for this project is available in the report GeoAR.pdf
