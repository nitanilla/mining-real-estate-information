# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction

This repository contains my code for Project 2: Real Estate Tycoon, part of the Machine Learning Masterclass offered by EliteDataScience.

The goal of this project is to develop a real estate pricing model that predicts the home transaction price to within $70,000.

The repository contains the following Python code:

* Module 1 - Exploratory Analysis.ipynb
* Module 2 - Data Cleaning.ipynb
* Module 3 - Feature Engineering.ipynb
* Module 5 - Model Training.ipynb

The raw data set used for the modules is in project_files/real_estate_data.csv.
The data dictionary is called Project-2-Data-Dictionary.pdf

The remaining objects in this repository are either intermediate copies of data tables created in the Modules, the final model created in Module 5 (final_model.pkl), or back-up copies of data. 

To get started with this repo, review the data dictionary and begin with Module 1. For a more guided introduction through the project, I highly recommend checking out EliteDataScience's Machine Learning Masterclass.
