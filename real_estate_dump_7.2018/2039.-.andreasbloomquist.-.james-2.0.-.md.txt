**Problem**

Searching for commercial real estate can be hard, especially when considering the multitude of apps and services available for residential real estate. For commericial, the process for finding a broker relies heavily on face to face networking and referals. However, we're in the 21st century, so it's time for a disruption.

**Solution**

Text James aims to make finding commercial real estate, fast, easy, and anonymous.
James utilizes Twilio to communicate as an anonymous third party between tenants and brokers. James takes users requests and forwards them anonymously to brokers. Brokers then can respond, again through James, with properties and pictures that might meet the tenants needs. If the tenant likes a property they can reply to show intersted. At this point James facilitates setting up a meeting time between the tenant and the broker.

**Technologies**

Built on the following:

- Ruby on Rails
- PostgreSQL
- JavaScript
- Twilio API
- Bitly API
- Uploadcare
