Concisely display monthly archives by year with links to each month.

== Description ==

Display monthly archives by year with links to each month in the following compact format:

    2012
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
    
    2011
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
    
    2010
    6 7 8 9 10 11 12

Serves as a drop in replacement for [`wp_get_archives( array( 'type' => 'monthly' ) );`](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_get_archives).

If you're interested in contributing to the code behind this plugin, it's also hosted on GitHub:
https://github.com/justincwatt/wp-monthchunks

== Installation ==

1. Extract the zip file, drop the contents in your wp-content/plugins/ directory, and then activate from the Plugins page.
1. Edit your theme file (e.g. sidebar.php) and replace the WordPress template tag `wp_get_archives();` with `monthchunks();`
1. You can also add it as a widget to any sidebar

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I make the years display in ascending order (2010, 2011, 2012...) instead of descending (the default)? =

The monthchunks function takes two optional parameters and the first is `year_order`, which accepts two string values: `"descending"` or `"ascending"`.

= Can I make months display in a format other than the default month number (1, 2, 3...)?

The monthchunks function takes two optional parameters and the second is `month_format`, which accepts three string values: `"numeric"`, `"alpha"`, or `"abbreviation"`. The "alpha" format displays the first letter of the month (e.g. J, F, M...) which may not make sense in all languages. The "abbreviation" format displays the language-specific abbreviation for the month, e.g. (Jan, Feb, Mar...).

== Screenshots ==

1. This is how Monthchunks looks with the Twenty Eleven theme. You can see here that 4 years of archives (eventually 48 links) take up less than 200 vertical pixels of precious sidebar real estate. Note that if you're browsing a monthly archive page, that month's number is emboldened, but not linked. If you hover over the link for any month, you'll see the localized month name and year as a *tooltip*.
