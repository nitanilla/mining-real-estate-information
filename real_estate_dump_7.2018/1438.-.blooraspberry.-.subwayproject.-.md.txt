# $17 Billion Dollars and A Century in the making, does the second ave subway line positively influence the social and economical development of upper east side? 

Overbudget and overdue, the 2nd Ave Subway is one of the most ambitious transportation development projects in NYC. Here we assess whether the wait and money spent on planning and constructing the subway was put to good use.


## Explored Topics

Economic Benefits

```
How does the # of businesses change before or after the subway? 
What type of the businesses change over time?
Does business tax income increase or not? 
How does it influence the housing prices / rental prices along the new subway line?
use the changes around Q line, L (Hudson Yards) as examples and references
Does it attract higher population/income to move here? (population, avg income)

```
Convienence Benefits
```
How much capacity does it free from other subway lines?
How much commuting time does it save for residents ?
How much it reduces the walking distance/time for nearby residents ?  
What are the income groups living in these neighbords right now ? (Service to underserved neighborhoods, minorities, disabled)
What kind of dogs live here? :wink: maybe, if make sense 
```
