This project uses data visualization to understand current and previous states of the real estate market in the -Greater- San Francisco Bay Area in United States. The dataset is from the well-known Zillow, an online marketplace for real estate properties. The dataset includes time series data from 1996 to 2017 on many key attributes of for the markets. Observations occur every each month on county level. I cannot include the dataset for obvious reasons but the link is here https://www.zillow.com/research/data/ .
