# Toronto-Real-Estate

Create a strong and diverse data pipeline for gathering information on the Toronto Real Estate market (easily replicable for other
Canadian markets)

Use private sector data from Yelp, Foursquare and other social media APIs to gather local/neighbourhood level information.

Use official data sources like the City of Toronto Open Data project, the Toronto Education Board and the Canadian Census to get 
information on demographics, schools, government facilities, etc.

Take this information and create a predicitve model for house prices.

Once the TREB releases historical house price data, incorporate that into the model.
