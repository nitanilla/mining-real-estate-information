PLEASE READ THE INSTALL SECTION COMPLETELY.

SelectBuf is a buffer explorer similar to the file explorer plugin that comes
with Vim, the difference being that file explorer allows you to view the files
on the file system, where as buffer explorer limits the view to only the files
that are already opened in the current Vim session. It is even possible and 
easy to extend the plugin with new commands.

Since the first time I released it in Jul '99 (try sending an email to 
vim-thread.1235@vim.org), the script has gone many
revisions and enhancements both in technology and features, taking advantage of all the niceties that the new versions of Vim has to offer.

For detailed help, see ":help selectbuf" or read doc/selectbuf.txt. 

- Install the plugin, restart vim and press <F3> (the default key binding) to
  get the list of buffers.
- Move the cursor on to the buffer that you need to select and press <CR> or
  double click with the left-mouse button.
- If you want to close the window without making a selection, press <F3>
  again.
- You can also press ^W<CR> or O to open the file in a new or previous window.
  You can use d to delete or D to wipeout the buffer. Use d again to
  undelete a previously deleted buffer (you need to first view the deleted
  buffers using u command).

You can change the default key mapping to open browser window by setting 

      nmap <unique> <silent> <YourKey> <Plug>SelectBuf

Almost everything is configurable, including all the key mappings that are
available. E.g., you can change the help key to <C-H> instead of the default ?,
so you can free it to do backward searches in the file list, using the
following mapping:

      noremap <silent> <Plug>SelBufHelpKey <C-H> 

Some highlights of the features are:

- It is super fast as the buffer list is cached and incrementally built as new
  files are added and the old ones are deleted.
- Hide buffer numbers to save on real estate (goes well with "Always On" mode
  or when used with WinManager).
- Opens a new window to avoid disturbing your existing windows. But you can
  change the behavior to reuse the current window or even to permanently keep
  it open.
- You can select block of buffers and delete or wipeout all the buffers at once.
- You can toggle various settings on and off while you are in the browser. You
  can e.g., toggle showing the buffer indicators by pressing i.
- Goes very well with WinManager.
- There are different sorting keys available. You can sort by buffer number,
  name, type (extension), path, indicators and MRU order. You can even select a
  default sort order
- If you use multiple windows, then the browser restores the window sizes after
  closing it.
- Syntax coloring makes it easy to find the buffer you are looking to switch to.
- Full configurability.
- Extensibility.
- Support for WinManager and multiselect plugins.
- and many more.
