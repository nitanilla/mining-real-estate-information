#### Mano Thanabalan 
at [Otonomos](https://otonomos.com/) :

Talk: A Concept Proposal for an Ethereum, IPFS and JVM powered dApp

"The Solidity programming language was built to address the non-deterministic way in which traditional languages such as Java compile into byte or machine specific code. The need for deterministic compilation to assembly language stems from deterministically calculating the running cost of a given Smart Contract. However, if the code, compiled byte code and variable state storage could be stored in a file in IPFS after being run and verified in a JVM, then deterministic compilation would no longer be a relevant requirement. Besides the obvious reduction in gas consumption, this design will also circumvent the Smart Contract gas limit and more complex smart contracts could be deployed."

Q. What are the steps I should follow as a novice in the new technology to establish a full time career as a BlockChain developer ?? Thanks

A1 First, understand a bit of how blockchains operate, there is a great [IEEE diagram that shows it for Bitcoin here] (http://thumbnails.visually.netdna-cdn.com/bitcoin-infographic_5029189c9cbaf.jpg)
Second, watch some presentation with concrete examples. If you're interested in Smart Contracts, for which developers are starting to be hired to develop, you should also check out Ethereum.
I would also suggest that you check out the companies that are looking for blockchain developers and see what their areas of interest here. Then look for open-source projects in those fields, and try to understand the concepts behind those. - Kobi Gurkan

A2 Best way to start off is using existing APIs available. Maybe you can try some [at our company] (https://api.coinsecure.in). We have multiple API methods open. - Mohit, Coinsecure

A3 I think learning the basics of how blockchains work and getting practical programming experience with Bitcoin wallet, transactions, APIs etc is the first step. - Muneeb Ali
