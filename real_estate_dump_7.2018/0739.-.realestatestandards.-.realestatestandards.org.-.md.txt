## Needed Projects
Below is a list of projects we would like to see take off.

### HTTPS Everywhere
Many MLS providers, IDX Providers, and Real Estate Websites are not HTTPS by default. We need a project going to track sites that do and do not use HTTPS. As of January 2016 HTTPS is even more important.

### Public MLS Directory
A public open source list of all MLS Boards, ideally with support for an API.
