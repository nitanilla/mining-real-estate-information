## Description
Using YelpData to analyze trends and answer questions about sucessful businesses

## Summary of Questions
* How does location influence business success?
* How do other factors such as hours open, stars, review counts influence business operations?
* Where are bad or unsuccessful businesses located?
* How might inherent user bias influence a review and how can that be normalized?

## Application of this knowledge
We can use this information gained from the questions asked to help businesses understand what factors do and don't influence success. Specifically, location isn't important, and it should be removed from real estate decisions because this analysis finds no solid information linking location to the success of a businesses. Similarly, we find that Yelp reviews as a whole do not have an influence on the success of a businesses. If one wanted to measure that it would be important to make a more comprehensive review system that took other factors about a reviewer in order to better understand what exactly makes a successful businesses. This information can be used to prevent people from opening restaurants since they are more poorly reviewed, however it should be made clear that everyone will receive bad reviews and that doesn't necessarily have an impact on how bad a businesses is.
