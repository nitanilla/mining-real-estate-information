# NYC-zip-code-profitability-analysis
We intend to search most profitable NYC zip codes for our rental estate business, using AirBnB &amp; Zillow data. 

We have AirBnb rental listing data in NYC for May 2017 (1, 2 & 3 bed apartment).


Additionally, we have monthly historical real estate data afrom Zillow (2 bed apartment), aggregated by zipcode.


Thus, we need to determine regions/zip codes with least break even time, assuming Zillow estate price as an initial investment while monthly rental income may be estimated from AirBnB listings.
