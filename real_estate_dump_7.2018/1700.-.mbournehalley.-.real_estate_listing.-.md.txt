Real Estate Listing Widget

# Front End Coding Test

## Create a real estate property listing widget.

You will get data from two feed APIs - samples of this 
data can be found in `batmanRealty.json` and `supermanRealty.json`. 
Using these sample files as a guide, please construct a widget 
that will correctly show these feeds.

Please note: data from actual feeds would follow the sample structures, 
and would have varying amounts of data ie. overlapping / missing values.

### Please adhere to the additional caveats:

* The widget should reasonably resemble the included design and account for different screen sizes/devices.
* The sort buttons are meant to be functional and should update the order of the properties when clicked. 
Note that only one of these buttons should be active at a time.
* The widget should function in the latest versions of Microsoft Edge, Chrome and iOS/Android browsers.
* Please use HTML, CSS and Javascript where applicable

Feel free to use any front end libraries/tools that you would like, 
but make sure that the final product (with viewable source code) is 
hosted somewhere public and/or that one can download and view it locally 
within a web browser. Thank you and good luck!

## The Sorting Button
* It sorts from Left to right, up to down in ascending order.
* If small devices Up to down in ascending order.


## To run the file
* Download this repo or download the dest folder.
* Run in local Server.
* If no local server install.
  * Download and Install NodeJS.
  * Install the http-server package from npm (npm install -g http-server).
  * In the root directory dest -> http-server.
