An Exploratory Data Analysis of Airbnb Listing Market in U.S. Cities using Python.

An analysis of Airbnb listings of popular US travel destinations in conjunction with Zillow's residential real estate data to predict price of Airbnb listings given the housing climate of a US city.

This exploration is conducted in three parts:

Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis of Airbnb Listings
        What are the Airbnb listing trends in the U.S. Market? What marketing recommendations can be made to Airbnb from these insights?

Part 2: Exploratory Analysis of Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) 
        How does housing price coorelate with Airbnb metrics and listing price? What marketing recommendations can be made here?

Part 3: Given ZHVI and listing trends, develop a linear model that can predict price given these two sets of features.

Also included is a research paper on the findings.
