A machine learning model to predict transaction prices for houses with an average error of under $70,000

# Project Context
My client is a large Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT).

* They invest in houses, apartments, and condos within a small county in New York state.
* As part of their business, they try to predict the fair transaction price of a property before it's sold.
* They do so to calibrate their internal pricing models and keep a pulse on the market.

# Current Solution
The REIT currently uses a third-party appraisal service. Appraisers are professionals who visit a property and estimate a fair price using their own expertise.

* Unfortunately, the skill levels of individual appraisers vary greatly.
* During a trial run, the REIT compared appraiser estimates to actual transaction prices.
* The REIT found that the estimates given by inexperienced appraisers were off by $70,000, on average!

# My Role
The REIT has hired me to find a data-driven approach to valuing properties.

* They currently have an untapped dataset of transaction prices for previous properties on the market.
* My task is to build a real-estate pricing model using that dataset.
* If I can build a model to predict transaction prices with an average error of under $70,000, then my client can replace inexperienced appraisers with my model.
