The idea behind this repository is for me to keep track of data or analyses relating in some way to the extraordinary
value gains in the Vancouver real estate market. And have a place where their quality, implications and limitations can
be discussed.


## Why git and why a public repository?
It keeps me honest. Data is messy and I learn of new data sources all the time. I misunderstand data. I get stuff wrong.
Git helps me keep track of my data and arguments, and allows me to refine these over time. A public repository keeps me
honest and makes sure I learn from my mistakes. Branches help me flesh out ideas that may benefit from public input but
are not ready to be quoted.

At the very least this will help me keep track of questions I answer and can serve as a platform that I can direct people
to that ask me a question I answered before. My hope is that others might find this useful and will engage in the
collaborative features GitHub offers.

Have a data question to ask or spot an issue with anything in this repo?
[File an issue](https://github.com/mountainMath/vanReData/issues/new)! Even
better, contribute your knowledge or correction [via pull request](https://github.com/mountainMath/vanReData/pull/new/master).

Don't like my style or judgement? Not a problem, just [fork](https://github.com/mountainMath/vanReData#fork-destination-box)
the project, make whatever changes you like and continue your own version.

I [thought about this before](http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/02/01/loss-of-character/), it's time to try this out.
