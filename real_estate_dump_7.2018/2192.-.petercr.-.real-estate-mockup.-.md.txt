**A Sample Real Estate Page with Material CSS**

This project is based on an original project by [Brad Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=Gu5Tz3rLaW-FcU0A6mUHG6bBTtV8MTUyNDc1NzE0OUAxNTI0NjcwNzQ5&q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.twitter.com%2Ftraversymedia&v=MaP3vO-vEsg&event=video_description) and you can view the full original [project here](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=Gu5Tz3rLaW-FcU0A6mUHG6bBTtV8MTUyNDc1NzE0OUAxNTI0NjcwNzQ5&q=http%3A%2F%2Ftraversymedia.com%2Fdownloads%2Ftravelville.zip&v=MaP3vO-vEsg&event=video_description)

My idea was to change it over to a mock real estate company in order to use it for my portfolio. Feel free to fork this repo and make any changes that would better suit you.
