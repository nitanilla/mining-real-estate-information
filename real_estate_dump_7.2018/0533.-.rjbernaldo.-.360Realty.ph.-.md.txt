# AngelHack Manila 2015: 360Realty.ph

## Problem
- So recently I was looking for a place to stay because I wanted to move out
- Went through several property listings, then I made a list of possible candidates filtered by 3 factors, (1) price, (2) location, and (3) how it looked on the photos
- So I was looking at around ~10 places, but when I visited each of them, they looked completely different than what was shown in the photos. What a waste of time right? Not only for me, but for the broker/owner as well.
- I ended up talking to a broker friend who helped me find my place today

## Solution
- Real estate listings website that features 360 degree images (photospheres) displayed in VR.

#### Buyers
- Save time & money by improving the filtering step of real estate search process
- See how the place looks on your own time, like you were actually there!

#### Sellers / Brokers
- Utilize the emergence of VR to provide self-serve property tours.
- Only get contacted by buyers who are really interested in the property.

#### Possible Difficulties
1) Not everyone has google cardboard
- FEATURE: Provide ability to view photospheres w/o VR (ala Youtube)
- NOTE: Cardboard can be bought for less than 1k, a relatively cheap investment compared to wasting your time visiting several places
2) Switching context from viewing a screen to being immersed in VR is not fluid
- FEATURE: Add on-screen or voice controls
3) Security
- FEATURE: Ability to censor certain parts of photosphere
4) Photospheres are Android only - nope
