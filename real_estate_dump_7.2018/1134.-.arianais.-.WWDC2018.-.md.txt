# To Infinity and Beyond!
 **This collaborative playground was designed to help children with mild autism, ADHD, and dyslexia with reading comprehension and organizational skills.** As many of these children have innate characteristics that make them natural-born coders, such as their ability to hyperfocus and see problems differently, coding is a natural medium to help these children with the difficulties they face. This plagyround uses SpriteKit, CoreMLâ€™s Vision API, Grand Central Dispatch, and UIKit to teach kids with learning disabilities these skills
 
 ## Some Notes from Mission Control
In this playground, two coders have recently both bought their very own planets. Together they will go on a joyride through space to check out their new real estate.

 ### Basic Instructions
Here are some tips to make sure your journey goes as smoothly as possible:
 - **Ensure only one person is looking at the screen at any point of time**, unless otherwise noted. That way you'll be able to watch out for unexpected asteroids coming your way!
 - Before passing the keyboard back to your partner, **scroll up the playground page so the top of the `Comment Template` borders the top of the computer screen**. Because fuel is limited on this mission, it is important that you code efficiently. Writing good  `Comment Template`s and making them visible to your partner will accomplish this.
