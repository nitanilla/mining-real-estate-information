# Real Estate Price Predictions
Use web scraping and regression to predict pricing for real estate listings from www.estately.com


In this project, we will review web scraping technqiues, data aggregation and cleaning, as well as supervised machine learning techniques (in particular, regression).

We will use BeautifulSoup to web scrape www.estately.com property listings in the New York City region. We will then use Google Maps API to geocode (find the GPS coordinates) of the properties, and use those as features in the dataset.

Finally, we will compare and hypertune Machine Learning algorithms to predict the listing prices.
