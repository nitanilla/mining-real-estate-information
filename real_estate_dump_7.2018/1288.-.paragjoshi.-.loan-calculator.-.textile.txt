h1. Description

While there are several web based calculators for finding loan payment, nothing beats the simplicity, speed and efficiency of good old command-line! 

In my opinion, executing <code> pmt 250000</code> is way faster than lauching browser, going to a website and finding your way around the GUI while ignoring all those annoying advertisements!

h1.  Implementation

This simple program is implemented in Ruby and also can serve as an example ruby program while being a little more advanced than commonly known Hello World program! 

h1. System Requirements

# You need a Ruby interpreter to run this program. 
# On Debian / Ubuntu run: 
** <code>sudo apt-get install ruby</code>

h1. Usage

<pre>
$  ./pmt <LoanAmt> [Rate] [LoanDurationMonth/Years] [TaxRate]
</pre>

or, on non-*nix platforms, assuming the Ruby interpreter is already installed, execute:

<pre>
c:/>  ruby ./pmt <LoanAmt> [Rate] [LoanDuration][Month/Years] [TaxRate]
</pre>

All parameters in <code>[]</code> are optional. <code>LoanAmt</code> is the only required parameter.

By default, <code>LoanDuration</code> is considered in years but you can specify in months by adding <code>m</code> at the end.  For instance, a value <code>15</code> would be 15 years but <code>16m</code> would be considered 16 months.

<code>TaxRate</code> is used for loan transactions where tax may be applied as a percentage of the loan amount. For instance, in the case of real estate purchase, typically property tax is payable as a percentage of purchase price of home. When a down payment is made, the house value considered would be different than the loan principal amount.

h3.  Default values

If the optional parameters are not supplied the following default values are taken:

| *Parameter* | *Default Value* |
| Rate | 6% |
| Duration | 30 years |
| Tax Rate | 1% |


h1.  Examples

h3.  Example 1:
<pre>
$   ./pmt 450000  5.5  20 
</pre>

This would compute the loan payment and tax on 450,000 (in your favorite currency) at 5.5% per year interest rate for a 20 year loan duration.

The following would be the output:
<pre>
	Principal=450000
	Interest Rate=5.5
	Loan Payment=3095.49288536656
	Tax=375.0
	Total Payment(including tax)=3470.49288536656
</pre>


h3.  Example 2:
<pre>
$   ./pmt 450000 5.5 36m 2 
</pre>

This would calculate the same loan for 36 months duration with 2% tax rate. 

The following would be the output:
<pre>
	Principal=450000
	Interest Rate=5.5
	Loan Payment=13588.1558119395
	Tax=375.0
	Total Payment(including tax)=13963.1558119395
</pre>
