## TALLER THAN TRUMP
#### Final Project Proposal
#### William Edward Bodell, Ubaldo Escalante, Steven Getz, Matthew Robert Lohry and Isabel Xiao

### Overview
Taller than Trump will visualize corporate branding of skyscrapers and other large urban structures around the world, using President Donald Trump's prominent global brand as a benchmark for measuring the prevalence and influence of transnational investments of capital in the urban environment. We will use data and imagery collected from SkyscraperPage.com to sort buildings from cities around the world according to the appearance of names of major corporations (Trump has 66 structures in the US, Canada, India, Panama, South Korea, The Philippines, and Turkey). Elevation images of most buildings are available in a standard size and format, which is ideal for visualization. Additional text data such as status, construction dates, floor and unit count, roof and spire heights, building use and description are also available. By comparing other major global brands to the controversial name of Donald Trump, the project seeks to reveal the political and economic forces driving the construction of the built environment, and their effects on skylines around the world.

### Target Audience
Taller than Trump will target both the general public, especially those who have an interest in politics, urban development or globalization, as well as people who work in fields such as architecture, real estate, urban design and planning. Many viewers from a wide range of backgrounds are very concerned about what it means to have a real estate tycoon as President of the United States, and will be curious to see how Trump stacks up against, for example, JP Morgan Chase, or South Korean multinational conglomerate Lotte Group. Anybody who lives in a city will be familiar with the branding of tall buildings, and those with critical or skeptical leanings may be interested in seeing how Trump's prevalence in the US and abroad compares to corporate brands in other countries and cities.

### Data Availability and Processing
The SkyscraperPage data will require web scraping, as the siteâ€™s database is not openly accessible. However, we have received written permission to use any material on the site, including the copyrighted elevation images, which will not require any processing once it is scraped, since all images are sized 1m per pixel. Other data from the site, such as name, date, location and height will require some text analysis to cull out common naming elements and reveal branding trends.

### Overall Idea
Taller than Trump is about how architecture and urban design intersect with complex political, social and economic conditions across a wide spectrum of geopolitical contexts. It highlights Donald Trump to make a point, both about the cumulative influence of corporate real estate on politics and urban life, and about the relative influence of the President's name compared to other multinational brands.

### Importance of the Piece
The project is important not only because it highlights the global stature of President Trump's corporate persona, but also because it reveals broader trends in real estate investment around the world. While real estate development declined due to the recession in Western markets, regions such as Southeast Asia have experienced booms. Corporate branding of urban space takes on a different nature where neoliberal market forces are non-native and create tensions with conflicting developmental ideologies and urban policies.
