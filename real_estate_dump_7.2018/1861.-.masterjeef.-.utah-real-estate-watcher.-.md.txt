# Utah Real Estate Watcher

The purpose of this tool is to monitor changes to real estate listings found on www.utahrealestate.com. Currently the housing market in Utah is on fire, many homes don't stay on the market for more than a few days. I hope this tool will give home buyers an edge in quickly discovering changes to listings.

Currently, it's only capable of recognizing new listings since the last execution.

The sample batch file (`./run-watcher-sample`) shows how to run the executable.
