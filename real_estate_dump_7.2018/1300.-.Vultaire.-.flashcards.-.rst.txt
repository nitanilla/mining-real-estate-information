renamed to reflect its now more general target audience.

Summary
=======

This is a quick application I coded in Python/Tkinter.  It is meant to
load a list of characters or words and display them one-by-one,
refreshing every 30 seconds or so.  The window can be set as
always-on-top, allowing you to passively study while working on other
tasks.

"Flippable" cards can be created by writing the word list as a CSV
file.  Each card is represented by one CSV line, containing one or
more comma-separated values.  To flip, just click the window to go to
the next value for the card.  `1`_

All options are configurable via the command line.  This is
intentional: I don't want a lot of GUI code in this application, and
I'd like to keep usage of screen real estate to a minimum.

A nice side effect of writing it this way: it should be easy to call
this program from within another tool or study program, for those so
inclined.

Requirements
============

You must have Python 2.7 with Tkinter, or Python 2.6 with Tkinter and
argparse.  The program has been tested on both Windows and Linux.

**Note:** This tool **must** have its arguments supplied via the
command line, or via a wrapper script; there are no interactive
GUI-based dialogs for telling the program what to do.

Footnotes
=========

.. [1] For advanced users, Excel-style CSV formatting is used, so it
   is possible to include quotation marks or commas in a value.
   double-quotes are used for both escaping and quoting values.
