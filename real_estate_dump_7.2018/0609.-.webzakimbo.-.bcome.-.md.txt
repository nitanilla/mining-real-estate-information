## Overview

It aims to simplify your day to day server management tasks by enabling access to your various estates from a single shell.

* Access all machines across *all* your platforms and environments from one interface.  

* Execute commands across platforms on multiple machines simultaneously, harnessing the power of Ruby to assist with real-time orchestration.

* Simple configuration enables static or dynamic network discovery.

* Upload & download files (as local or sudo user), and execute commands directly on remote hosts (on either individual, or groups of hosts simultaneously)

* Fully customisable for extending the framework with custom commands & tasks.

* Easy integration into existing Ruby projects.

* Dynamic network discovery for EC2 hosted machines (more providers to come). Static network definitions for everything else.

* Transparent usage of locally configured SSH keys

* Integrates easily with Capistrano 

## Security

The framework has no knowledge of your SSH keys, nor does it store them or interpret them in any way, merely acting as a transparent conduit for commands over SSH, with all commands being delegated to your underlying operating system.

## Safety

With great power etc - it is assumed that users have been given the correct privileges for the machines under their control, and that they understand the functions of this tool.
