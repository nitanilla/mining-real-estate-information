# Scripts To Go

_Are you sated?_

I develop my scripts mostly for
[Fatdog64 Linux](http://distro.ibiblio.org/fatdog/web/).[1]
Fatdog64-7xx is built from _Linux From Scratch (LFS)_, and maintains
excellent compatibility with [Puppy Linux](http://puppylinux.com/).

These scripts assume that the GNU versions of various shell commands are
installed, and that GTK2+ is the GUI toolkit.

Unless otherwise noted, the Software in this repository is licensed
under the terms of the GNU GPL version 2 (GPLv2) license.

These scripts are written to be compatible with the POSIX-compliant _ash_
shell, a [busybox](https://busybox.net/about.html) applet. The she-bang line is
generically set as `#!/bin/sh` to simplify packaging across Linux variants. For
scripts that require features of a specific shell, the she-bang is set to
reflect the required shell, i.e. `#!/bin/bash`.

## dndmate

Drag-and-drop Collector and Automator

**Usage Scenarios**

* You have multiple filer windows open in different folders, and you want to
  perform an action (run a command) targeting some of the files in some of the
  open filer windows.
* You keep an ongoing list of file paths, and you want to add files to the list
  with a mouse action from a filer window, and also with a simple shell command.
* Some of the above scenarios, targeting web links in addition to files, i.e.,
  keeping a list of web bookmarks.

**Installing**

* Download and unpack the repository snapshot
  [tar file](https://github.com/step-/scripts-to-go/archive/master.tar.gz).

**Extensions**

If gmenu2 finds script `gmenu2-fdcp` somewhere in the `PATH` it
automatically adds menu entries for all Fatdog64 control panel items.

**Dependencies** - [gtkmenuplus](https://github.com/step-/gtkmenuplus).

**Help** - Hover over menu entries for tooltip help.

**Thanks** - Gmenu2 was inspired by SFR's GMenu script.

**Screenshot**

Note the typical Puppy Linux system sub-menus, and the additional
'Wine', 'Uncategorized', 'Recent', and 'Gmenu2' sub-menus.  'Recent'
automatically tracks item and launcher activations for quick re-use.
Recent items are shared with _quicklaunch_, another menu script in this
repository.

<a href="gmenu2-fdcp"></a>
## gmenu2-fdcp

Fatdog64 Control Panel As a Menu

**Usage Scenarios**

* Quickly viewing and running the many system functions that the
  Fatdog64 Control Panel provides.
* Displaying a Control Panel menu with a global hotkey.

**Installing**

* Download and unpack the repository snapshot [tar file](https://github.com/step-/scripts-to-go/archive/master.tar.gz).
* Run `install/install-gmenu1-fdcp.sh` from the unpacked folder.
  `--help` is a command-line option.

<a href="quicklaunch"></a>
## quicklaunch

Customizable Desktop Panel and User Menu

**Usage Scenarios**

* Condensing Fatdog64 Desktop Panel icons into a single icon to free
  some Panel real estate.
* Displaying a quick-launch menu with a global hotkey.
* Automatically tracking your command usage for quick re-use.
* Keeping all customized commands in a single text file.

**Installing**

* Download and unpack the repository snapshot [tar file](https://github.com/step-/scripts-to-go/archive/master.tar.gz).
* Run `install/install-quicklaunch.sh` from the unpacked folder.
  `--help` is a command-line option.
* Optionally set a global hotkey to activate the menu.
  For the _Sven_ keyboard manager: open the Preferences dialog, select
  **Keyboard**, **New** **Description** _Quicklaunch Menu_ **Key code**
  _Win+x_ **Runs** Program _/root/quicklaunch.gtkmenuplus_.

Optionally, replace multiple Desktop Panel icons with a single icon that
starts the quicklauch menu. Instructions for LXQt Panel users:
Edit file _~/.config/lxqt/panel.conf_.  If you don't have this
file, copy the system default file _/etc/xdg/lxqt/panel.conf_ to
_~/.config/lxqt/panel.conf_ then edit the latter.  Look for section
`[quicklaunch]`. By default in Fatdog64-710 it looks like this:

```
[quicklaunch]
type=quicklaunch
apps/size=4
apps\1\desktop=/usr/share/applications/default-browser.desktop
apps\2\desktop=/usr/share/applications/urxvt.desktop
apps\3\desktop=/usr/share/applications/rox.desktop
apps\4\desktop=/usr/share/applications/fatdog-control-panel.desktop
```

It may look differently on your system if you have customized your LXQt
panel.  Change the above to:

```
[quicklaunch]
type=quicklaunch
apps\size=1
apps\1\desktop=/root/.local/share/applications/quicklaunch.desktop
```

Then restart X for the changes to take effect. Now your LXQt panel
should include just one icon, and when you click it a menu for the four
default icons that your replaced should be displayed.  Should you want
different menu items edit file _~/quicklaunch.gtkmenuplus_.

If you did add the quicklaunch icon to the Desktop Panel, you may also
want for the menu colors to match the Desktop Panel theme. How to do so
is explained in _~/.local/usr/share/applications/quicklaunch.desktop_,
which sets the Onyx theme by default. If your desktop uses a different
theme edit _quicklaunch.desktop_.  Instructions are given in the file.

**Dependencies** - [gtkmenuplus](https://github.com/step-/gtkmenuplus).

**Help** - Read section `---- Help ----` of file _~/quicklaunch.desktop_.

**Screenshot**

The Quicklaunch Menu icon is installed in LXQt Panel, the vertical bar
on the left side), and replaces the default set of application icons;
Default Web Browser, Rxvt-Unicode, ROX Filer and Fatdog64 Control
Panel. The Panel bar is unincumbered while the default applications
can still be accessed as menu items. Moreover, there is a sub-menu of
ROX Filer bookmarks, and an automatically-updated sub-menu of "Recent"
command invocations. Those are the commands that the user invokes
frequently through Quicklaunch.  In this picture, Quicklaunch sports the
Onyx theme.
