## zillow-api-call.R
Zillow is a company which hosts real estate data for the US market. A lot of useful information about property details can be used
to create machine learning models for the US real estate market.

The code here does a simple API call to zillow and parses the data into a data frame for further analysis.

## analysis.R
I managed to get hold of some ad campaign data set. Here I read code from mongodb and reshape it to make it suitable for analysis
Some crude data analysis code is present during the latter part of this file. This is still work in progress.
