Why don't you just do it yourself?
==================================

Bugs. Tickets. Issues. Stories. Cards. Whatever you call 'em here's the place where you say “it's borked” and then someone else can try to fix it. This repository exists only as an issue-tracker for Norton Imperial Labs. Perhaps one day we'll replace it with a standalone piece of software? For now, this is it.

We work in working groups. Each of the issue tags belongs to one group. If you raise an issue, tag it with the right group, and assign it to the person who bottom-lines that group. They can always re-assign it to someone else later. If you raise an issue and no tag fits, then it might be time for a new working group.

These are the current working groups and the folks responsible:

* **Branding** — Nick Badger ([`@badg`](https://github.com/badg))
* **Community** — Tom Lowenthal ([`@flamsmark`](https://github.com/flamsmark))
* **Crowd-funding campaign** — Enrique Santos ([`@blueminder`](https://github.com/blueminder))
* **Decision-making process** — Nick Badger ([`@badg`](https://github.com/badg))
* **Incorporation** — Enrique Santos ([`@blueminder`](https://github.com/blueminder))
* **Infrastructure** — Ryan Rix ([`@rrix`)](https://github.com/rrix))
* **Real estate** — Robbie Trencheny ([`@robbiet480`](https://github.com/robbiet480))
