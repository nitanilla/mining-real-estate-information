# ScheduleACreator
Real Estate Form Optimizer

A simple Visual Basic application intended to streamline the creation of the Schedule A legal contract. Typically, these forms lay out rules to which both the Tenant and Landlord abide by when renting a property space. But for busy real estate agents, creating them is a tedious process. Even trying a copy/paste procedure using a superfluous amount of text files is agonizing when navigating through reams of visually indifferent clauses. With this motivation in hand, this program attempts to aid in speeding up the process of pumping out these rules and guidelines.
