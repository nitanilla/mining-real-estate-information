#BLACKBOOK SYSTEMS WARRANT CANARY

Existing and proposed laws, especially as relate to the US Patriot Act, etc., provide
for secret warrants, searches and seizures of data, such as  contents of webservers.

Some such laws provide for criminal penalties for revealing the warrant, search or seizure, 
disallowing the disclosure of events that would materially affect the users with data hosted BLACKBOOK.SYSTEMS' servers.

BLACKBOOK.SYSTEMS and its principals and employees will in fact comply with warrants and their provisions for secrecy.
BLACKBOOK.SYSTEMS does not hold keys to private data stored on its servers.

BLACKBOOK.SYSTEMS will make available a "warrant canary" in the form of a cryptographically signed message containing the following:

- a declaration that, up to that point, no warrants have been served, nor have any searches or seizures taken place

- a cut and paste headline from a major news source, establishing date

Special note should be taken if these messages ever cease being updated, or are removed from this server.


The current message is here:

NOVEMBER EIGHT TWENTY FIFTEEN

Notes:

This scheme is not infallible.  Although signing the declaration makes it impossible for a third party to produce arbitrary declarations, it does not prevent them from using force to coerce BLACKBOOK.SYSTEMS to produce false declarations.  
The news clip in the signed message serves to demonstrate that that update could not have been created prior to that date.  It shows that a series of these updates were not created in advance and posted on this page.

BLACKBOOK.SYSTEMS can be contacted for business at r00t@blackbook.systems
