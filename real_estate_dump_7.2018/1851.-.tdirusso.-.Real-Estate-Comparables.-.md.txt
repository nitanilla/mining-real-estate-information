## Real Estate Comparables Java Application Using Zillow API and MySQL

This Java Application is dedicated to empowering users with the graphical data they need to make preeminent decisions when purchasing/investing in real estate.  Users can enter a valid address to retrieve an average price of 5 comparables.  Comparables are regarded as the single-best tool in determining a home's value. They contrast criteria from recently sold properties in a neighborhood, such as sale price, age of house, size, and square footage. Real estate agents use comps to prepare a Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) for their clients.  

The data (address and respective comp price average) is then stored locally in a MySQL Database.  The user can then choose to display the graph of the average comps for the property they entered.  

After the first property is searched, it is stored and later used in the 'recently searched properties' drop-down menu for easy access.
