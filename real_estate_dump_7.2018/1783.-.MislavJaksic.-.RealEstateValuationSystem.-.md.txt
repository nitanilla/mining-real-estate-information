## Real Estate Valuation System

Did you ever wonder for how much money you could sell your house? But how are you going to determine the price? The Real Estate Valuation System takes important property characteristics as input and outputs the value the property based on collected data.

The system is designed to valuate any type of property, anywhere on the planet, but only the valuation of apartments in Croatia based on publicly available data gathered from advertisement websites is currently implemented.

Example:
- Run ValuateApartment.py in the GUI folder
- Input your apartment characteristics and click Valuate apartment button
- Wait until the system outputs the Value of property

Design notes:
- General design considerations can be found in the Docs folder
- Each folder has their own README which talks about design and class responsibility
