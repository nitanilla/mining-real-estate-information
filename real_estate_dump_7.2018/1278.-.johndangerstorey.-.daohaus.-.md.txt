# Daohaus

Daohaus is a social experiment to test pure democratic governance.  The aim is to purchase, manage, and enjoy a single real estate property.  The hope is to use this small success to expand and grow the idea from that of a property to the governance of a community, and even a nation.  Hopefully bringing to fruition the lofty vision of a more pure, accountable, and representative government of the people, by the people, for the people. 

A simplified version of our current day government really boils down to the creation of laws, the enforcement of those laws, and the management of an escrow account that we all fund through our taxes.

This project is focused on replacing all of the above â€” however,  on a much smaller scale and through basic mechanisms.  We start small so that we can learn from flaws in the design, build it incrementally, and test our hypothesis as it grows following an Agile mentality.

In the same way that the Bauhaus movement was characterized by a minimalist type of design, we also hope to simplify and minimize governance of shared community assets.

To get a better grasp on how we would achieve this vision and the technical specs, read the full [Daohaus Whitepaper](Daohaus_Whitepaper.md)
