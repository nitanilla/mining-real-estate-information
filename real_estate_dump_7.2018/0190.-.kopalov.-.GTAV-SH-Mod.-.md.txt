## Features
- **Real Estate Office** Purchase and sell houses at the real estate office in Rockford Hills (Briefcase Symbol)
- **Houses** With the total of 69 houses there will be endless ways to replay the game.
- **Hotels and Apartments** There are 43 hotels and apartments available for rent with varying costs and durations.
- **Interiors** Each house, apartment or hotel suite has a interior (currently there are 15 interiors in total)
- **Custom Interiors** We are developing custom interiors some will be based on location with working windows and some can be used everywhere. Even in your Custom Savehouse!<br>
*Please note that R* *did not make many interiors for GTA V. We are adding custom-built interiors in each version, but those take some time to build and can lower your FPS count when nearby.*
- **Custom Savehouse** Don't like any of the houses we provided then create a custom savehouse and assign the interior you want anywhere on the map.
- **Custom Savespot** Created your own custom map and want to enjoy our mod with it then create your own custom savespot.
- **No Grouping** Characters own their houses so they won't live together.
- **Multiple characters** can live in the same hotel.
- **Realistic pricing** depending on exteriors and locations.
