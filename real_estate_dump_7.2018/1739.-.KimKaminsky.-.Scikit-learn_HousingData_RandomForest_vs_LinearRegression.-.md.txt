# Scikit-learn_HousingData_RandomForest_vs_LinearRegression

The purpose of this study was to advise a real estate brokerage firm in its attempt to utilize machine learning for assessing the market value of residential real estate. This study extended a previous study that compared four modelling techniques, (Linear Regression (LR), Ridge Regression (RR), Lasso Regression (LaR), and Elastic Net (EN)). The code for the previous study is found in the file Kaminsky_Kimberly_Assign3.py. This paper added a fifth technique, Random Forest (RF). This code for this study is found in the file Kaminsky_Kimberly_Assign4.py. The best hyperparameters from the first study were applied in this round, along with an investigation of hyperparameters from the Random Forest. GridSearchCV was used to find the best parameters for the RF. The best models for each technique were compared utilizing the root mean squared error (RMSE). A cross validation design was used in order to select a method providing good generalization.
