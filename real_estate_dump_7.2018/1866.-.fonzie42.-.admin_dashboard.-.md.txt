Welcome to our Real Estate System!
==


Hey, welcome!
This a college assignment where we are working in a real estate management system.

Our dashboard (management, without transactions for now), is based in the [akveo's blur admin front end framework](https://github.com/akveo/blur-admin), using Angular 1.5.

The installation is very simple:

 1. Install **node** if you don't already have it
 2. Install **gulp** if you don't already have it 
 3. Clone the repo
 4. Run `npm install` (it can take a while)
 5. Run `gulp serve`
 
 And that's it!

Development guidelines
----------
 1. The main focus should be in the `src/app/pages/ ` where we have our components.
 2. More to come ;)
