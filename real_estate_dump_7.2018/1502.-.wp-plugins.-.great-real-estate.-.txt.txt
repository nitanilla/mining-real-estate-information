Great Real Estate WordPress Plugin allows you to create and manage any kind of real estate on your WordPress site, from commercial and residential listings to a property management site.  

== Description ==

[Main Site](http://greatrealestateplugin.com/) | [Support Forum](http://greatrealestateplugin.com/forums/) | [Documentation](http://greatrealestateplugin.com/docs/) | [Showcase](http://greatrealestateplugin.com/showcase/) | [Premium Modules](http://greatrealestateplugin.com/premium-modules/)

Great Real Estate was developed to enable real estate agents, brokers, and realtors to display and manage information about their listings in WordPress pages.

The property information and listing templates allow for consistent display of the property listings across the site. Authors do not need to format the content, they simply enter it into a form.

Widgets and custom page templates permit display of only available homes, only sold homes, a random "featured" home, and a detailed property page for a listing.

= Works best if the following plugins are also installed =
* NextGen Gallery - to upload, manage, and display property listing photos
* PanoPress - to display panorama photos in a Flash 360 degree interface ("virtual tours")

Feeds for Trulia, Zillow and Yahoo media are integrated into the plugin now!

You'll need a Trulia, Google Base, and Zillow account to enable feeds.  Google Maps is now supported natively in the plugin but you can use an API key for tracking purposes or a large number of listings (Google has a daily geocoding limit around 100 calls)

To use the panorama plugin, you'll need to obtain the Flash Panorama Player, appropriately licensed for your domain.  We recommend CuTY.

Please read the documentation carefully... to get the most out of this plugin, you may need to edit some of your theme files, and/or copy files from this folder to your theme folder

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get support? =

The plugin author has set up a Forum for support questions and announcements at [the support forum](http://greatrealestateplugin.com/forums/)

The forums are the quickest place to receive support and other users can also benefit from the questions and answers as well.

= What are the template tags I can use? =

Generally, they are the functions in the PHP file templatefunctions.php. But please visit the plugin homepage for complete details on all the tags, and how you can use them in The WordPress Loop.

= How can I change the currency? =

Simply create a localization file for your language and/or locale. You can use the existing translation files as a staring point.

= What can I change in the plugin's output? =

There's quite a bit that you can do if you are comfortable with HTML, PHP and the WordPress API.  See our website tutorial on customizing templates here:  [Template Customization](http://greatrealestateplugin.com/documentation/customizing-templates/).  We strongly recommend avoiding changes to the core code, as these will be lost on upgrade of the plugin and you'll need to manually move the changes each upgrade.

== Installation ==

[Quick Start Guide] (http://greatrealestateplugin.com/quick-start-guide/)

1. Unzip into your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory. 
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Make your settings in the Admin panel "Real Estate"
- be sure to choose a main Listings page
- for a quick preview, check the options to automatically generate the page info
4. Create sub-pages under the main listings index page; they should automatically display additional input form fields to capture listing information
5. See the plugin website for detailed template function documentation  [Documentation Link] (http://greatrealestateplugin.com/docs/)
