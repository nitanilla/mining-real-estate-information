# Closest-Realtors

This code was written to find the closest real estate agencies within 10 miles of 2 locations that the user inputs. To run the file, download both code.py and data.txt to the same directory. Then open the terminal, cd to the directory and use ">> python code.py" to run the file. Then enter two locations relatively close to Austin, TX, which is the city where the real estate agencies were data mined in the data.txt file. To use this code on other locations, simply data mine the locations of other real estate agencies in another file and rename the input file in code.py.
