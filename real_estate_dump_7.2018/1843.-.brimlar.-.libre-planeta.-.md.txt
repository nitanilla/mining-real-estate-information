# libre-planeta
A website for listing simple, intuitive, and attractive real estate listings, complete with Craigslist code generator, written in PHP / MySQL.

It is meant to be a simple, secure, privacy-loving method to post important real estate info in a visually attractive, easy to navigate manner.  Instead of pagination for photos with Javascript, it uses a "long page" style to minimize the need for clicking and which degrades nicely for mobile devices.

The code assumes the usage of an SSL certificate to provide anonymity and security to people who browse the website, which you will have to generate or purchase on your own.
