Creates a portable real estate listing management system. Designed to work with any theme using built-in templates.

## Description ##

You’ve got to have a really good reason to change the name of a successful WordPress plugin.

With WP Listings, version 2.0 gave us that reason, IDX integration.

### WP Listings is now IMPress Listings ###

Just like WP Listings, the IMPress Listings plugin creates a listing management system for your WordPress site. It still is fully responsive and works with nearly any WordPress theme.

IMPress Listings adds some important new features to what was already a great plugin. Most notably, MLS integration through the use of the [IMPress for IDX Broker]( https://wordpress.org/plugins/idx-broker-platinum/) plugin.

### Demo ###
View a demo of the plugin in action: [IMPress Listings demo](http://demo.wp-listings.com/)

> **Importing from your MLS**
> No more typing in listing information that you have already added to your MLS. With IMPress Listings and IMPress for IDX Broker, you can automatically import basic listing details.
>
> Want even more listing content imported? Switch to our Equity framework for your WordPress website. A WordPress site running Equity, IMPress Listings and IMPress for IDX Broker can import full listing details.
>
> *IDX Broker subscription required.

### Default Taxonomies and Terms ###

* Status (Active, Sold, Pending, For Rent, Reduced, New)
* Property Types (Residential, Condo, Townhome, Commercial)
* Location
* Features

Use the taxonomy creation tool to create your own way of classifying listings (i.e. bedrooms, bathrooms, locations, price ranges) and use those taxonomies to allow users to search for listings. Then, reorder the taxonomies as needed.

Find listings by taxonomy using filters in the WordPress admin.

### Widget ###

Includes a Featured Listings widget to display listings in any taxonomy (Property type, Status, Location, etc.). Display them in a custom number of columns.

Also, a Quick Search widget to allow visitors to search your listings by taxonomy.

> **Premium Listing Templates**
> Make your listing pages look like single property websites with our [premium listing templates](http://www.agentevolution.com/plugins/).
> These templates use their own styling and navigation to look like a unique website without any of the extra work or expense.
> Install any or all of our premium listing templates and use them for all of your featured listings.

### Migrating from AgentPress Listings ###

If you're using the [AgentPress Listings](https://wordpress.org/plugins/agentpress-listings/) plugin, we've made it easy to switch to IMPress Listings. The plugin uses the same post type name and data fields (plus several more) so all your entered listing data will remain in place.

### Automatic Map Insertion ###

No more embedding a map into your listing pages. Enter the property’s latitude and longitude and a map is automatically added to the listing page.

Using IMPress for IDX Broker? Longitude and latitude is automatically added for your imported listings.

### Property Display ###

Single listings display the custom data automatically with no need to insert shortcodes to display listing data. If it's entered, it will display on the page.

Don’t want to show the price on a listing? Check a box and the price is hidden. That simple.

Supported property fields:
* Price
* Address
* Country
* MLS Number
* Year Built
* Floors
* Square Feet
* Lot Square Feet
* Bedrooms
* Bathrooms
* Half Baths
* Garage
* Pool
* Open House date and time
* Photo gallery
* Video or virtual tour
* Map
* and more!

### Enhanced Theme Compatibility ###

While we would love for you to use one of our Equity themes with IMPress Listings, we have made it easier to work with your favorite WordPress themes. The plugin now allows custom page wrappers to better fit your theme.

### Contact Forms ###

Listing pages include a contact form for visitors to inquire about a property, or the form can be replaced with your own form plugin shortcode.

Save time by adding a contact form to all listings instead of one at a time.

### Flair for Developers ###

A lot of developer goodies came in WordPress 4.4, including API support. Developers looking to use the latest WordPress tools will love IMPress Listings.

We have built in WordPress API support for the listing post type and default taxonomies. This will allow skilled developers to create their own applications around listing content.

There is also support for taxonomy featured images. Assign an image for active properties, solds, featured listings, neighborhoods, or an other taxonomy you should create.

### Integration ###
Integrates with the [Genesis Agent Profiles](https://wordpress.org/plugins/genesis-agent-profiles/) plugin to display the listing agent(s).

Feel free to contribute to this project on [Github](https://github.com/agentevolution/wp-listings).

## Installation ##

1. Upload the entire `wp-listings` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Begin creating listings and listing taxonomies

### How to use the listings shortcode ###

### Basic usage ###
Just enter the following shortcode on any post or page

`[listings]`

### Advanced usage ###
The shortcode accepts the following parameters:

`id` = listing post id (accepts one or more id's), exclusive, cannot be combined with other parameters, except for columns
`limit` = limit the number of posts to show, defaults to all
`columns` = display output in columns, accepts values 2-6, default is 1 column
`taxonomy` = taxonomy to display (must be used with the term parameter)
`term` = term to display (must be used with the taxonomy parameter)

Example advanced usage:
`[listings taxonomy="status" term="active" limit="10" columns="3"]`
This will display all listings in the "Status" taxonomy, assigned to the "Active" term, limited to 10 listings, in 3 columns

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Can I import listings from my MLS? ###

Yes. With an IDX Broker subscription and adding their IMPress for IDX Broker plugin to your site, IMPress Listings can import featured properties from the MLS.

### I already use the AgentPress Listings plugin, can I use this plugin? ###

Yes. This plugin can be used instead of the AgentPress Listings plugin. It uses the same post type name and custom field names (along with several new fields), so the posts you've added using AgentPress, along with the associated meta data, will remain attached to the listing post. Just be sure to deactivate AgentPress before activating IMPress Listings.

### My theme already has a single listing template. How do I use the one provided with the plugin? ###

Some themes may already have a `single-listing.php` (and archive.php for listing archives) to display listings with the same post type name of 'listings'. Templates placed within your theme folder have precedence. To use the template(s) provided with the plugin, delete the `single-listing.php` and/or the `archive-listing.php` templates within your theme's folder (recommended to make a backup).

### How can I create a custom single listing template? ###

Name your template file `single-listing-CUSTOM-NAME.php` (replace CUSTOM NAME with your own descriptive name). You can use the single-listing.php within the plugins /includes/views/ folder for a guide on how to display the post type data. You'll need to include the following block of text at the top of your custom template:
`/*
Single Listing Template: Test Template
Description: Give it a description to help identify
*/`

### How can I remove the default property status terms or property type terms? ###

Its possible to remove the default property status terms by using a filter in your theme or custom plugins. Here is an example for the status terms:

`/* Remove Default Status Terms from IMPress Listings */
add_filter( 'wp_listings_default_status_terms', 'custom_default_status_terms' );
function custom_default_status_terms() {
  $status_terms = array();
  return $status_terms;
}`

Here is an example for the property terms:

`/* Remove Default Property Terms from IMPress Listings */
add_filter( 'wp_listings_default_property_type_terms', 'custom_default_property_type_terms' );
function custom_default_property_type_terms() {
  $property_type_terms = array();
  return $property_type_terms;
}`
