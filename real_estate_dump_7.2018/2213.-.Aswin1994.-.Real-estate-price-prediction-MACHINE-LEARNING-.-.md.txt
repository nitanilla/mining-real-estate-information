# Real-estate-price-prediction-MACHINE-LEARNING-
presents the implementation of price prediction project for the real estate markets and housing. Many algorithms are used here to effectively increase the accuracy percentage, various researchers have done this project and implemented the algorithms like hedonic regression, artificial neural networks, AdaBoost, J48 tree which is considered as the best models in the price prediction. These are considered as the base models and by the help of advanced data mining tools algorithms like a random forest, gradient boosted trees, and ensemble learning models are used and prediction accuracy is attained in a higher rate. The results and evaluation of these models using the machine learning and advanced data mining tools will have the more influence in the price prediction.
