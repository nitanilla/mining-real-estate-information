I ommitted the Sphinx and the Test portions of the tutorial.
The tutorial is outdated, I used a newer version of Ruby and Rails.
I also used MySQL instead of PostgreSQL.
Maybe in future I create my own tutorial based on this tutorial but with updated code.

## System Configuration
* Ruby 2.2.5p319
* Rails 5.0.1
* Used MySQL57 instead of PG
* Git 2.10.2.windows.1
