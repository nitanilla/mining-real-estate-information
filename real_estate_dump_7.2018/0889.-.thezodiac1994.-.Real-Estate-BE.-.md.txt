# Real-Estate-BE

The project aims to implement a Machine learning algorithm that can predict real estate prices relatively accurately among other algorithms to be implemented and suggest areas that are most suited for investment based upon the parameters like total budget and total area in various areas in and around Mumbai.The aim of this project is to examine the feasibility of various machine learning algorithms in real estate price prediction and use the one that is most accurate. To achieve the aim, multiple (to be finalized as the project model develops) indicators/parameters will be selected as the input variables (Year, Rate per square ft, Geographical features like distance to airport, distance to highway, number of hospitals,etc) and real estate price/sq ft in the next quarters is used as output variable. The quarterly data during ~ 2005-2016 is to be employed as the data set to construct the model and the data is expected to be obtained using Web Scraping. With the scenarios, real estate prices in future are forecasted and analyzed. The experimental results will be used to compare the various Machine learning algorithms based on various error calculation methods like mean squared error (RMSE).
