## Overview & Planning

I created a real estate crm app for tracking clients.

After the idea, I created the ERD layout and followed the relationships to build out my tables for the database.
Afterwards I ran scripts to make sure the backend worked before I created the database on heroku. The most important thing
in this process to keep breaking down each problem into smaller problems and make sure I followed each step to the T. The hardest
part of this was to re-train and constantly remind myself not to skip ahead. It's very easy to lose track of the task at hand, so staying
organized and commit often was the best way I tackled my problems. I also started to add in git commits of what I will be working on next, so
that it helps me keep on track when I check the commit log.

## Future Iterations

On next update we plan to add more user fields for clients.<br>
Users will not have to fill out every field to update client.<br>
Version 3 update will include a database for signed documentations.<br>
