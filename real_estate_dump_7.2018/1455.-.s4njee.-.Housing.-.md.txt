## Housing New York

The Housing New York plan has financed 62,506 affordable homes since its inception in 2014 - breaking records for most new construction financed for a consecutive three years with 20,854 total homes financed.

That total includes enough affordable housing to serve more than 160,000 low-income New Yorkers. Sixty-seven percent of the financing went to preserving the affordability of 41,652 existing apartments, which currently serve more the 100,000 New Yorkers.

By creating innovative and cost effective programs to create sustainable affordable housing for the very lowest-income families – including seniors, veterans and families in City shelters -- the administration has created more homes for the lowest income New Yorkers than in previous administrations:

More than a quarter of all affordable housing financed under the Mayor’s plan are serving New Yorkers making less than $31,100 for an individual or $40,800 for a family of three.
More than 14 percent serve New Yorkers making less than $19,050 a year, or $24,500 for a family of three.
The administration is ahead of schedule to reach its goal of creating or preserving 200,000 units of affordable housing in ten years.

New Yorkers can apply for affordable housing at   nyc.gov/housingconnect<https://a806-housingconnect.nyc.gov/nyclottery/lottery.html#home> or by calling 311.
