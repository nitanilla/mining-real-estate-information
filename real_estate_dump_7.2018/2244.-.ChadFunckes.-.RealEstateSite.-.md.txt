# RealEstateSite
Real Estate Demo Site

In our spare time, trying to make a Commercial Real Estate Listing site

Site uses HTML, CSS, foundation.js, Jquery, PHP, AJAX...etc...

Initial SQL is in the admin folder...the stored procedures must be run IAW your database requirements.

The initial EER diagram was done in MySQL Workbench.
