This is the [Salesforce.com Mobile SDK](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-iOS) iOS native demo app shown during the [Painless Mobile App Development Webinar](http://www.developerforce.com/events/webinars/2012-06-27/registration.php?d=70130000000scMv) on June 27, 2012.

The goal of this presentation is to show the basics of getting a simple iOS app set up using the Salesforce.com Mobile SDK.

The app is built and tested on version 1.2.2 of the [Salesforce Mobile SDK for iOS](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-iOS). You'll want to clone that first (and run the install scripts) before trying to build this app.

#Getting this app set up in your own Database.com org
You can sign up for a Database.com account at http://database.com/

**PLEASE NOTE: THE APP REQUIRES YOUR DATABASE.COM or SALESFORCE.COM ORG TO BE CONFIGURED AS FOLLOWS. LOGGING INTO AN ORG THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE CORRECT CONFIGURATION WILL NOT WORK.**

You will then need to set up the two objects used in this demo: Property and Repair. The metadata for both is included in the aptly named "metadata" folder. You should be able to deploy these with the Force.com IDE, which is based on Eclipse.

The sample data used in the webinar is included in the sampledata folder. You can use the Developer Console in Database.com to create the data in your org.

####Or Salesforce.com

Note: there's no particular reason you'd have to use Database.com here instead of Salesforce.com. If you have a Salesforce.com org you'd prefer to work with, the app will work just fine there too.
