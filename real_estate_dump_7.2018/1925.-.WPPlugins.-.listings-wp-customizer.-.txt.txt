Customize your property listings with this simple plugin that allows you to style the Listings WP property listing plugin using simple colorpickers and custom CSS.

== Description ==

Listings WP Customizer adds a Customizer menu to the settings of the Listings WP [Real Estate Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/listings-wp/) plugin, to allow you to easily style your real estate & property listings by using simple colorpickers.

### Style your Property Listings
You can now easily style your **property listings** and **real estate listings** any way you like. 

Each colorpicker controls the color of an individual element on the frontend of the Listings WP plugin.

There is also a new CSS field added that allows you to insert any custom CSS, so that you can have absolute control.

The plugin adds the new colors by using the `wp_add_inline_style()` function which inserts the new styles inline, making it faster loading.

You can also filter the output of the CSS using the `listings_wp_customizer_css_output` filter, allowing you even more control such as different styling on different property listings (or many other possibilities).
