# C#: LINQ, Forms, Events, Files (Real Estate Analysis)

### The Application
The task is to write an application that analyzes real estate (housing) transactions.
You should work as a team on this assignment. One member should be the project lead, and will assign
parts of the assignment to members. The project lead will also assemble the final project and submit it
via blackboard.

### Requirements:
1. The application must read a comma-separated file (SacramentoRealEstateTransactions.csv) to get the
transactions. This is based on actual house sales in the Sacramento area over a multi-month
period.
2. Use LINQ queries to order the real estate transactions, and perform basic analyses of
the data (average price and count).
3. Must use classes to represent the transaction objects.
4. Must use the DataGridView, ListView and other controls.
5. Filter controls (ListView, Checkbox, Button) must be properly initialized and respond properly to
events.
