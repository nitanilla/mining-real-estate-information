## What is Rise Token

Rise Token is a smart contract token on the
Ethereum platform that is based on the standards of
ERC20. Rise Token expands the access of global
investors to real estate, and diminishes the entry
barrier to investment in real estate and real estate
development, which would normally be something
difficult to get into. Furthermore, by making use of
blockchain technologies, we are able to breath new
tech into real estate industry.
Particularly, it would allow for the use of tokens in
real estate purchasing, P2P rentals, morgage
contracts, and real estate management.
