You will need the devtools package to download a few needed packages, in order to runs Shiny app

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rstudio/leaflet")
devtools::install_github("MangoTheCat/radarchart")

```

I will revist this page after a blog post about this, but very briefly for now

- inspired by the superzip Shiny example by Joe Cheng
