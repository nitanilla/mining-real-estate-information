     Interesting note about race:

     Single, Multiple, and Bridged Race In 1997, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued revised standards requiring Federal collection programs to allow respondents to select one or more race categories. In order to provide uniformity and comparability of the data before all or most of the data are available in the new multiple-race format, it was necessary to ‘‘bridge’’ the responses of those for whom more than one race was reported (multiple race) to one, single race. See the “Technical Notes” of Births: Final Data for 2010 and Deaths: Final Data for 2010.

The investigation examined 11,244 slayings that took place between Jan. 1, 2000, and Dec. 31, 2010. What they found was a trail of murder, grief and forgotten lives. Their search for answers stretched from Malibu to Pomona and from Mount Wilson to Long Beach.

## What is a homicide?



## The inclusion (or not) of justifiable homicides


http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2012/06/justified_to_kill_read_why_det.html

> Worthy, whose office reviews all fatal shootings, believes Detroit police over-report justifiable homicides to the FBI to lower its criminal homicide rate, which still is among the highest in the nation..."I know they don't report with accuracy," Worthy said. "It's self-reporting. __All the things they call justifiable may not be justifiable__, is what I'm trying to tell you..."As a general proposition, I believe that a lot of cities under-report (criminal homicides) because they don't want to be seen as the most violent."
> 

Justifiable homicides removed from homicide tallies - http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/18/nyregion/justifiable-homicides-taken-off-the-books-alter-a-murder-tally.html

> When the Police Department counts the killings in 2015, a year when the official tally of murder in New York City was only slightly above its historic low, the preliminary figure of 350 homicides will not include the death of Mr. Williams, 26. His shooting was deemed justified by Queens prosecutors and was removed in late December from the official tally of city murders.

> The story of how the city’s official murder number was reduced by one coincided with a bitter public feud between the police commissioner, William J. Bratton, and his predecessor, Raymond W. Kelly. Mr. Kelly accused the department of underreporting shootings and murders, but provided no examples of when it had done so.

Discrepancy between police and prosecutor judgment, differences in opinion on including involuntary manslaughter:

> Joyce’s spokeswoman, Lauren Trager, disputed Sack’s numbers while noting that her office was now sending prosecutors to homicide scenes to try to build stronger cases...In the past eight years, Trager wrote in a statement, the overall homicide issue rate has ranged from 51 to 72 percent. As of July 2, Joyce’s office issued charges against 20 defendants — about 62.5 percent — in homicides that took place this year...Sack said the city police statistics followed FBI standards for counting homicides while the prosecutor counted some other crimes, such as involuntary manslaughter. “You’re comparing apples to oranges,” he said.

# Lies, damned lies, statistics



https://www.guernicamag.com/interviews/simon_4_1_11/

> David Simon: One of the themes of The Wire really was that statistics will always lie. Statistics can be made to say anything. You show me anything that depicts institutional progress in America: school test scores, crime stats, arrest reports, anything that a politician can run on, anything that somebody can get a promotion on, and as soon as you invent that statistical category, fifty people in that institution will be at work trying to figure out a way to make it look as if progress is actually occurring when actually no progress is. I mean, our entire economic structure fell behind the idea that these mortgage-backed securities were actually valuable, and they had absolutely no value. They were toxic. And yet they were being traded and being hurled about, because somebody could make some short-term profit. In the same way that a police commissioner or a deputy commissioner can get promoted, and a major can become a colonel, and an assistant school superintendent can become a school superintendent, if they make it look like the kids are learning and that they’re solving crime. That was a front-row seat for me as a reporter, getting to figure out how once they got done with them the crime stats actually didn’t represent anything.


### The purpose of the "board" and the simplification of data

http://www.thewireblog.net/offthewire/precision-on-the-homicide-board/

http://wypr.org/post/watch-part-6-baltimores-homicide-numbers-spike-closure-rate-drops#stream/0

> When Major Donald Bauer of the Baltimore Police Department’s Homicide Unit looks at the high numbers of homicides in 1993 and 2015, then compares the clearance rates, he scratches his head.  The Homicide Unit was closing cases at a very high rate in 1993 (though not the highest on record for city) and in 2015 was closing cases at the lowest on record.

http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2000-12-30/news/0012300179_1_homicide-detectives-homicide-unit-stanton

> For years, the wall-sized Formica board symbolized Baltimore's losing battle with violence, captivating viewers of the TV show "Homicide: Life on the Street." Yet frustrated police leaders viewed it as demoralizing, a reminder that killings in the city had spiraled out of control. They removed it two years ago..."It got to be a morale factor," Detective Maj. Robert M. Stanton, commander of the homicide unit, said yesterday. "The detectives were getting their butts kicked."...This year, Stanton and homicide detectives asked to restore the white board, where names stenciled in black signified a solved case, red an open one. They were confident that they could raise the number of cases cleared and help reduce the number of city homicides.

# Discrepancy in classification of accidental gun deaths


http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/us/children-and-guns-the-hidden-toll.html

> A New York Times review of hundreds of child firearm deaths found that accidental shootings occurred roughly twice as often as the records indicate, because of idiosyncrasies in how such deaths are classified by the authorities. The killings of Lucas, Cassie and Alex, for instance, were not recorded as accidents. Nor were more than half of the 259 accidental firearm deaths of children under age 15 identified by The Times in eight states where records were available.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12671106

> The incidence of unintentional pediatric firearm deaths is significantly underreported by the Miami-Dade County ME when the classification of "accidental" firearm death is used. Reviewing the manner of death classification criteria or establishing an intent code on official death documentation is recommended. Furthermore, clinicians should be aware that the true incidence of unintentional gun death may be higher than that reported as accidental.

> Update, June 19, 2013: As time goes on, our count gets further and further away from the likely actual number of gun deaths in America—because roughly 60 percent of deaths by gun are due to suicides, which are very rarely reported. When discussing this issue, please note that our number is by design not accurate and represents only the number of gun deaths that the media can find out about contemporaneously. Part of the purpose of this interactive is to point out how difficult it is to get accurate real-time numbers on this issue.

## Difficulties in comparison

https://numeracy.co/reports/policeviolence
https://medium.com/@sirwart/the-story-behind-the-data-26ceb25c39b4#.iq4pudj1p

> Basically, they all have slightly different definitions of what’s included in the dataset and what’s not. For example, The Washington Post has the narrowest criteria and only considers deaths where an on-duty police officer shoots and kills someone. There are about 970 deaths in 2015 that all 3 sources agree fall under that definition.

The origin of data
The politics of why data isn't collected

- http://gawker.com/what-ive-learned-from-two-years-collecting-data-on-poli-1625472836

> The biggest thing I’ve taken away from this project is something I’ll never be able to prove, but I’m convinced to my core: The lack of such a database is intentional. No government—not the federal government, and not the thousands of municipalities that give their police forces license to use deadly force—wants you to know how many people it kills and why.

> I’ve been lied to and delayed by state, county and local law enforcement agencies—almost every time. They’ve blatantly broken public records laws, and then thumbed their authoritarian noses at the temerity of a citizen asking for information that might embarrass the agency. And these are the people in charge of enforcing the law.

## What does "median mortality of eight months" signify in our vernacular?

https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/gould

>The problem may be briefly stated: What does "median mortality of eight months" signify in our vernacular? I suspect that most people, without training in statistics, would read such a statement as "I will probably be dead in eight months" - the very conclusion that must be avoided, since it isn't so, and since attitude matters so much.

- http://www.wsj.com/articles/prosecutors-wont-charge-hinckley-with-murder-in-brady-death-1420233183

> Mr. Brady, who was gravely wounded during the assassination attempt, died this past August at the age of 73. A few days later, the Virginia medical examiner ruled his death was homicide resulting from a shot fired by Mr. Hinckley in 1981. As a result of that ruling, federal prosecutors in Washington began looking into whether Mr. Hinckley should be tried on a new murder charge...Prosecutors would also be hindered by a rule in effect in Washington at the time of the shooting that said homicide charges could only be brought if a victim died within a year and a day of his injuries.

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/opinion/sunday/someone-dies-but-that-is-only-the-beginning.html

>
Here’s one small example of why: Women who write are more likely, according to the study, to quote at least some women in their articles. That diversity of outlook, with its range of voices, is worth pursuing because it better reflects the world. Or how about the number of women in Times obituaries? The poet and feminist Lynn Melnick complained on Twitter last week that only seven of the past 66 obituaries were on women. (My count yielded similar numbers.) Obituaries are chosen on the basis of the newsworthiness of their subjects; but that is subjective. It’s not outrageous to wonder what might change if more women were involved in all aspects of their selection and presentation.

Obits as data

http://www.nypl.org/blog/2011/11/09/great-obituary-hunt-genealogy-research-guide

http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-real-estate-uses-big-data-to-track-clients-1431615728

> Morry Eghbal, a co-founder of the website Successors Data (briefly known as ObituaryLeads.com), says the 1-year-old company, based in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., is nearing 1,000 paid subscribers at $99 a month. The company scours title company records for estates of deceased homeowners that are likely to enter the probate-court process, as well as obituaries nationwide to find potentially motivated sellers.


http://psc.dss.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/HTML/facts_cameron_obit.html

> Cameron, Playfair, and Wellum (1994) counted obituaries in various gay community publications and claimed to be able to use them to calculate the average life expectancy for homosexuals...Their conclusion – that homosexual men and women have a shorter life span than heterosexual men and women – provides a textbook example of the perils of using data from a convenience sample to generalize to an entire population.

Cache invalidation -- Prepping obituaries 


http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/08/insider/when-death-comes-and-the-obituary-quickly-follows.html

> His death was tremendously important news. Within an hour of Mr. Cook’s announcement, The Times had a 3,500-word obituary on its website, by John Markoff, with Steve Lohr. Both were on the team that later won a Pulitzer Prize for its “penetrating look into business practices by Apple and other technology companies that illustrates the darker side of a changing global economy.”


What appeared to readers as if it happened in minutes was a product of work that began Aug. 1, 2007, when Mr. Markoff sketched out the first words of his obit:

> Steven P. Jobs, a child of Silicon Valley and a college dropout who reshaped the world’s culture around personal computing and digital media, died X and the age of X. The cause of death was X according to X.

> The answer for most people is no. Although the Times has about 1,700 “advances,” or drafts on file, the paper typically starts an obituary if someone is an octogenarian, has been in and out of Cedars-Sinai recently, or has a well-publicized drug problem.

> ...It’s easier to predict the demise of the elderly, but the paper has recently been caught off guard by several deaths like David Bowie, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and despite several brushes with death, Amy Winehouse.

Edgar Hoover and Charles Lindbergh and Walter Winchell, were written long ago and now require updating. Recently, when President Johnson was in the hospital for gallbladder surgery, his advance obituary was brought up-to-the-minute; so was Pope Paul’s before his trip to New York; so was Joseph P. Kennedy’s. For an obituary writer there is nothing worse than to have a world figure die before his obituary is up-to-date; it can be a harrowing experience, Whitman knows, requiring that the writer become an instant historian, assessing in a few hours the dead man’s life with lucidity, accuracy, and objectivity.

> Adam Liptak’s fine obituary for Justice Scalia, written about two years ago, was a key element in the coverage, but it didn’t appear in its entirety right away. A few paragraphs posted with the news alert. But even though the 4,700-word obit was essentially ready, because of the need for updates, it was about an hour before a full version was posted...Still, having a prepared obituary does not do much good for print readers if a prominent figure happens to die at the wrong time of day, and some subscribers were unhappy, among them Don Noel of Connecticut, a former newspaper editor who wrote to register his dissatisfaction...Given the fact that a lengthy obituary had already been prepared, it was unfortunate that it took so long to post it in full. And while early print deadlines for the Sunday edition are a fact of life, it’s regrettable that many print subscribers had no whiff of this huge news in their Sunday paper.

A question of cache invalidation: How much has to be changed about an obit that was written 2 years ago? How much had been written about Scalia since then?

# Complexity of death in determining risk

Public release of cardiac surgery outcomes data in New York: what do New York state cardiologists think of it? http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9424074

Death-Rate Rankings Shake New York Cardiac Surgeons http://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/06/nyregion/death-rate-rankings-shake-new-york-cardiac-surgeons.html

> When Newsday published the doctors' list, Dr. Dal Col had only 68 operations and a record that was among the state's worst. (When the state began releasing the surgeon data on its own the following year, it included only those doctors who had at least 200 cases, saying that fewer than that produced rates that were not statistically significant.) Concerned, the partners in Dr. Dal Col's practice decided he would be in a more "protected" position if he operated at St. Peter's, a community hospital that handled fewer crisis cases.

Death in a database field

Computer `Killed' Hartford Jurors Before They Could Serve http://articles.courant.com/1992-09-29/news/0000111915_1_grand-jury-jury-pools-jury-selection-process

Hartford residents would have been included in grand jury pools over the past three years if not for one small problem: The computer thought everyone in town was dead...Until the error was discovered earlier this month, the only explanation offered for the absence of Hartford names had been random chance. But it was not a particularly persuasive argument; the odds that the names had been missed through random selection were roughly equal to the likelihood of dealing three dozen consecutive royal flushes...**The problems came to light in a lawsuit challenging the racial makeup of the grand jury that indicted Luis Colon Osario, a defendant in the $7.1 million Wells Fargo robbery. Hartford and New Britain account for 68 percent of the minorities in the Hartford**

# Medical errors and death

http://www.bmj.com/content/353/bmj.i2139

Without medical error being a category of death, they didn't show up in death certificates.

https://www.propublica.org/article/study-urges-cdc-to-revise-count-of-deaths-from-medical-error

> The Centers for Disease Control instruct doctors to list only medical conditions as the underlying cause of death on death certificates, a definition that excludes medical errors. A recent study by researchers at Johns Hopkins says that if medical errors were accurately documented, they would rank above suicide, diabetes and Alzheimer's disease as a cause of death.

Closed Homicide Rates / Misleading "Clearance" Rate

http://mpdc.dc.gov/page/homicide-closure-rates

http://www.npr.org/2015/03/30/395069137/open-cases-why-one-third-of-murders-in-america-go-unresolved

http://homicidewatch.org/2012/03/04/links-roundup-calculating-mpds-homicide-case-closure-rate/

> To use the FBI's terminology, the national "clearance rate" for homicide today is 64.1 percent. Fifty years ago, it was more than 90 percent.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26TRIz2d1m8



Clearance is not conviction:

> And that's worse than it sounds, because "clearance" doesn't equal conviction: It's just the term that police use to describe cases that end with an arrest, or in which a culprit is otherwise identified without the possibility of arrest — if the suspect has died, for example.

> ...Today, Richmond's homicide clearance rate routinely hits percentages in the 80s and 90s, depending on which reporting standard is used.


http://www.dailynews.com/general-news/20150124/lapd-closed-homicide-cases-without-bringing-killers-to-justice-analysis-shows

Reporters compared across different departments:

> The LAPD cleared some of these cases because the D.A. declined to prosecute, but when asked for the reason each case was cleared, police officials did not respond. The data excludes fatal shootings by officers.
Out of all homicides for which the LAPD provided the Los Angeles News Group a case status, 11.5 percent fell into this “cleared other” category. The national average was 4.9 percent, according to FBI statistics from 2011 through 2013, the only published years. The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department didn’t classify any cases this way.


> ..San Fernando Valley LAPD officials referred all questions regarding their solve rate to headquarters; officials there would not address Valley figures.

(JUDGED BY CLEARANCE RATES)

> In recent years, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck has hailed falling crime and high clearance stats. For example, in 2011 Beck lauded the department’s murder solve rate of 83 percent in 2009 but didn’t give any breakdown. However, according to the Los Angeles News Group analysis of LAPD case data, its 2009 solve rate was 49 percent. When asked, the LAPD would not account for the discrepancy.

http://cops.usdoj.gov/html/dispatch/march_2008/homicide.html

> During this same period, however, some police departments have maintained consistently high clearance rates. **The 90 percent clearance rate** of the San Jose, California, Police Department is partially attributable to its mandatory rotation policy, which requires specialized assignment detectives to return to patrol every 5 or 6 years. The logic behind this policy is to maintain a patrol force that includes officers and sergeants with investigative training and experience.

### Trying to be objective

https://medium.com/@nselby/why-our-police-killings-data-doesn-t-include-incident-summaries-5b4268aa93ec#.wd7pdt9a4


> Nobody cares what we think about whether an incident in which an unarmed civilian lost his life was justified. __What we all care about is that we get the data right__ — and when we screw that up, we do everything in our power to fix it and be transparent about it...We founded the PKIC database because we needed more facts and less analysis on officer-involved killings of unarmed civilians. Adding more editorial was not the path to accomplishing that mission.

> A database without context is like a gigantic buffet at a cheap resort: It looks huge, but there’s really very little meat there.


https://medium.com/@nselby/how-context-helps-us-better-understand-the-killing-of-jeremy-mardis-b4e6808da10f#.ktrl1f174



### What context should be included? Who decides?

http://www.streetcredsoftware.com/pkic/

> Context is king. Every incident is unique, but context helps guide investigators and analysts: Was the person killed high on methamphetamine or flakka? Was he in the process of assault on another civilian? Was she an escapee or fugitive? Had she been previously diagnosed with a mental illness? Was he drunk? Was the officer injured or killed? Did the officer have a history of excessive force complaints? Did the decedent have violent convictions?

> https://medium.com/@nselby/learning-lessons-from-police-killings-8cf2578cfd6d#.ampi1ifpo

> To Chief Forté’s point: in an analysis of 569 media stories, media was more than four times more likely to mention the race of the officer when the decedent was black than when he was white. That’s highlights a not-too-subtle, and inarguable, media bias.

## Proxies


https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/04/23/this-may-be-the-best-way-to-measure-gun-violence-in-america/

> It does not account for all the times when a gun is fired in anger, fear or by accident and the bullet simply misses its mark. Yet whether a bullet kills or injures someone is an almost random outcome from a violent act. It is influenced by the shooter’s aim, if the bullet happens to strike vital organs and even how far a victim must travel to reach a hospital trauma center. “It’s just not the whole picture,” said Jennifer Doleac, an assistant professor of public policy at the University of Virginia, who studies the connection between gunfire and crime. __“There’s a lot more gun violence than what is reflected in homicide rates.”__

# Surveillance, improvement of reporting systems

The National Violent Death Reporting System: an exciting new tool for public health surveillance. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17170168

> The US does not have a unified system for surveillance of violent deaths. This report describes the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), a system for collecting data on all violent deaths (homicides, suicides, accidental firearms deaths, deaths of undetermined intent, and deaths from legal intervention, excluding legal executions) in participating states. The NVDRS centralizes data from many sources, providing a more comprehensive picture of violent deaths than would otherwise be available. The NVDRS collects data on victims, suspects, and circumstances related to the violent deaths. Currently, 17 US states participate in the NVDRS; the intention is for the NVDRS to become a truly national system, representing all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the US territories. This report describes the history of the NVDRS, provides an overview of how the NVDRS functions, and describes future directions.

http://research.google.com/pubs/pub37209.html

>  Surveillance efforts have turned to modern data sources, such as Internet search queries, which have been shown to be effective for monitoring influenza-like illnesses. However, few have evaluated the utility of web search query data for other diseases, especially those of high morbidity and mortality or where a vaccine may not exist. In this study, we aimed to assess whether web search queries are a viable data source for the early detection and monitoring of dengue epidemics.

# Death and software design

https://research.facebook.com/publications/legacy-contact-designing-and-implementing-stewardship-at-facebook/

> While it might intuitively seem like Facebook should fulfill
these kinds of requests, Facebook has no way of knowing
what a deceased person would have wanted. Did that son
want to be friends with his father on Facebook? And who
gets to decide if a profile photo is or is not “appropriate?”
These are choices that are made by account holders while
they are alive, and Facebook respects those choices. In the
absence of the deceased account holder, and given the
changing needs around profiles post-mortem, we looked for
ways to improve how Facebook supports grieving
communities. 


> An inherent challenge to any post-mortem system involves weighing improvements and changes against people’s established expectations of the feature, especially given that those who have died cannot update their settings or declare their preferences about an expanded set of functionality. How the privileges granted to legacy contacts should change over time and independent of the deceased is an open research question.

# Data joins and comparisons


http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2773949/

> Record linkages with national databases are essential for accurate prevalence estimates from disease registries, and the SSDMF is an inexpensive means to supplement linkages with the NDI to maximize death ascertainment.
