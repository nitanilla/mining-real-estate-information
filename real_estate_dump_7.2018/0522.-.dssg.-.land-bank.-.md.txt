An analytics tool to help the Cook County Land Bank acquire vacant and abandoned properties strategically.

This project is a part of the 2013 [Data Science for Social Good](http://www.dssg.io) fellowship, in partnership with the [Cook County Land Bank](http://www.cookcountylandbank.org) and [DePaul University Institute for Housing Studies](http://www.housingstudies.org/).

*For a quick and gentle overview of the project, check out our [blog post](http://dssg.io/2013/07/11/cook-county-land-bank.html).*

## The problem: vacant and abandoned property
Parts of Cook County have long struggled with vacancy and abandonment, but the recent foreclosure crisis spread these problems into areas which had previously experienced relative stability. 
Many of the properties that went into foreclosure ended up becoming vacant because the residents would abandon the property long before the foreclosure process was completed. 

These abandoned homes can lower property values, serve as magnets for crime and decay, and reduce tax revenues.

## The solution: analytics web tool to target properties
The Cook County Land Bank Authority (CCLBA) was created in January 2013 with the goal of returning these properties to productive use. The agency won't have the resources to invest in every property, and the appropriate policy strategies from community to community.

Our purpose was to create a web tool to view and understand Cook County's property data, and to analyze it in order to help the CCLBA develop its policy strategies.

1. Build a usable web interface for both public use and for use by land bank employees that interfaces with a Postgres database in order to organize, query, and access the data in a convenient manner.
2. Create a model that will determine the critera by which the Cook County Land Bank which neighborhoods to help first, which properties in that neighborhood, and their potential new uses.

## Project layout
- `analysis`: exploratory data analsys of real estate and demographic tends in Cook County.
- `web`: a django app that implements the analytics tool and a data API backend to power this tool.

## Installation guide

Here's the software you'll need to install:

- GIS software: ArcGIS 10.1 or QGIS
- Postgres 9.1
- PostGIS
- Python 2.7.x
- Numpy  1.7.1
- Sympy  0.7.2

Next, clone the repository and configure Django to enable South and TastyPie, and to interface with your Postgres database.

Then, run an initial South migration to create database tables/views:

```
$ python manage.py schemamigration landbank_data --initial
$ python manage.py migrate landbank_data
```


Finally, modify and run load_*.py scripts with desired input files to populate base tables.
