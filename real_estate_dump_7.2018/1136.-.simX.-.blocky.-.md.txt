# blocky
A content-blocking Safari extension for iOS, designed to block virtually all images/media

The internet is so chock full of dumb stuff these days.  From megabytes and jigabytes of data wasted on advertisements, clickbait, and other stupid shit, it's hard to focus on really valuable content.  This is even more true on a phone, where you have limited screen real estate to wade through the rivers and rivers of BS.

The key insight of this content blocker is cultural: virtually all of the hard-to-ignore annoying crap on the internet are pictures.  So you might as well imagine everything is a nail, and just block all images and media.  That's what Blocky does.  And along with a breath of fresh air, you'll also get so many more side benefits: much less downloaded data, so your phone's battery life will improve and you'll be able to last longer on your monthly allotment of cellular data.  (If this sounds eerily similar to ClickToFlash, it's because it kind of is.)

The lone exception I've made is for images from Twitter's image server, which makes the mobile Twitter site work fairly normally.  These are literally limited to the "pbs.twimg.com" URL, so you'll still see that some images are blocked if they come from other websites (particularly images in Twitter cards).  Blocky also blocks everything Facebook, because, come on, do you really need an explanation?

If, for whatever reason, you really really wanna see all the internet BS, simply tap-and-hold on the reload button in Safari's search bar, and then select "reload and ignore content blockers".

Blocky is best combined with limiting cookies in Safari to "the current website only".
