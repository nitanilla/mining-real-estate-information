# Open JSON Schemas

The most valuable parts of the software we are collectively developing are the unique and proprietary functionality we are creating. However, much of the data we are interacting with shares a common core which, to be honest, is actually quite mundane. And yet we are collectively defining and re-defining these same basic objects over, and over, and over.

What do we have to lose in sharing schemas for non-proprietary data objects? Nothing. What do we have to gain? A lot. By sharing common definitions, we are enabling the Semantic Web and Internet of Things to interact within and between services. We are enabling more efficient collaboration. And we are increasing the speed of development.

This repository is meant to include collaboration on JSON schemas for common objects. This is by no means definitive. You can use it as a starting point and extend the objects with custom attributes. Contributions are welcome if you find things that would be generally useful.

Let's spend less time re-defining the pre-defined and move on with our collective futures and what we came here to do -- make a difference in the world!
