# Alces Clusterware

A set of tools and conventions for improving the ease of use of HPC facilities -- within both traditional clusters and HPC cloud images.

## Available platforms

* Enterprise Linux 7 distributions: RHEL, CentOS, Scientific Linux (`el7`)
* Enterprise Linux 6 distributions: RHEL, CentOS, Scientific Linux (`el6`)
* Ubuntu LTS 16.04 (Xenial Xerus) (`ubuntu1604`)

## Prerequisites

The install scripts handle the installation of all required packages from your distribution and will install on a minimal base.  For Enterprise Linux distributions installation of the `@core` and `@base` package groups is sufficient.

## Installation

### TL;DR

One-line installation - **note that you must verify you have the correct value for** `cw_DIST`:

```bash
curl -sL http://git.io/clusterware-installer | sudo cw_DIST=el7 /bin/bash
```

### Basic installation

Clusterware is a system-level package and must be installed by the `root` user.

1. Become root.

   ```bash
   sudo -s
   ```

2. Set the `cw_DIST` environment variable to match the distribution on which you are installing. Currently available options are `el7`, `el6` and `ubuntu1604`:

     ```bash
     export cw_DIST=el7
     ```

3. Invoke installation by piping output from `curl` to `bash`:

   ```bash
   curl -sL http://git.io/clusterware-installer | /bin/bash
   ```

   If you want to you can download the script first.  You might want to do this if you want to inspect what it's going to do, or if you're nervous about it being truncated during download:

   ```bash
   curl -sL http://git.io/clusterware-installer > /tmp/bootstrap.sh
   less /tmp/bootstrap.sh
   bash /tmp/bootstrap.sh
   ```

4. After installation, you can logout and login again in order to set up the appropriate shell configuration, or you can source the shell configuration manually:

   ```bash
   source /etc/profile.d/alces-clusterware.sh
   ```

### Advanced installation

For further installation techniques, please refer to [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Usage

Once installed and your shell configuration is sourced, you can access the Clusterware tools via the `alces` command, e.g.:

```
[root@localhost ~]# alces
Usage: alces COMMAND [[OPTION]... [ARGS]]
Perform high performance computing software management activities.

Commands:
  alces gridware        Compile and install gridware for local environment.
  alces help            Display help and usage information.
  alces module          An enhanced environment modules utility.
  alces session         Manage interactive VNC sessions.

For more help on a particular command run:
  alces COMMAND help

## What next..?

_This is all great for admins of traditonal HPC clusters, but how can this help me get things done in the real world?_ Luckily for you Clusterware isn't just for admins, unlike tradional HPC tools its been designed from the ground up with modern day technologies in mind - why not try spinning up your own environment on [AWS](https://github.com/alces-software/clusterware-deployment-methods) or your private [OpenStack](https://github.com/alces-software/clusterware-deployment-methods) estate and get to experience the power of clusterware in helping you just get stuff done!
