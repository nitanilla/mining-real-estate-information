Real Estate Predictions: A machine learning model

This is a simple machine learning model I made which predicts the prices of real estate based on certain parametres such as number of bedrooms, plot size and other key factors affecting the prices of houses.
It makes use of the random forest model to predict prices. I have included the datasets which are needed to train the model and validate it later.

File description:

1. submission_file.csv - my final predictions file

2. train.csv - dataset to train or fit the model

3. test.csv - dataset to test the model and predict the prices

4. main.py - the python program file 

Data sources - www.kaggle.com

I also entered this model in a competition on Kaggle through my Kaggle profile @mehtavishwa30
