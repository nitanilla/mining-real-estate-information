The Purpose of this project is to build and test the technology and understand any legal process or security problems that should be taken into consideration before the project is launched. 
Throughout history new technology has been implemented to secure real estate ownership and transactions, and the properties associated with a particular real estate. In the beginning there was not even paper, thus putting the land registry on paper was a way to secure records of ownership. 

The following is the list of some of the improvements which will be taken into consideration for creating the blockchain.
	- Eliminating the need for physical archives of contracts and files.
	- Greater security for users of the system, in part because validation of the purchasing contracts and ownership can be done independently 
	- Faster and more transparent transactions
	- Official registration and confirmation of pending ownership which was around four months earlier , than in the current process, which allows more information and data of transactions to be readily available, increase liquidity of real estate since it can be sold soon to the to be owner, and more
    - Elimination of the possibility of selling a property more than once
    - Making it more difficult to steal a property

Hence, by using a blockchain solution, land registries can both reduce the need to retain physical archives and create greater, faster visibility. Also, according to the World Bank, only 30% of land rights are registered or recorded worldwide.

The project includes a private blockchain that can be run by a group of public and private entries.
