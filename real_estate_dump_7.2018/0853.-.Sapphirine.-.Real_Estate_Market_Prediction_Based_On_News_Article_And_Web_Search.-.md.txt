# Real Estate Market Prediction based on News Article and Web Search

Big Data Analytics Project

##  Overview
we propose a novel approach to real estate market trend prediction by employing sentiment analysis and machine learning principles. We execute extensive crawling over web articles and perform NLP over extracted web articles to extract the sentiment feature. Then through careful calculations, we translate the sentiment features into quantitative data, which is analyzed by our machine-learning algorithm to determine its correlations with the real estate market trend. The prediction model basing on the correlation is presented and evaluation of its validity performed.
Methodology wise, the entire model can be narrowed down to four essential steps: data acquisition, data processing, sentiment score generation, and prediction model.
