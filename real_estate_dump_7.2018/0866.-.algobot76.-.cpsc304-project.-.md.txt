## Project Description

The domain we are going to model is the housing or real estate market.

Aspects of the real estate market that we will model involve information that customers would be interested in when searching for housing. Realtors and real estate posting information (eg. location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, price, square ft.) are examples of what would be modeled. There would be multiple types of real estate postings and each of these would contain different information (eg. properties for sale or properties for rent).

There will be two different classes of users in our system: customers and realtors. Customers will be able to query for real estate postings that match their criteria as well as contact the realtor of postings for more information (eg. requests for open house tour). Realtors will be able to create new postings, edit their postings, and delete their postings. They will also will be able to access customer contact requests.

This project will be implemented using the CS departmentâ€™s oracle database, JDBC, and JavaScript for the front-end application.
