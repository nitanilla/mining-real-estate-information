# re_python


Similar to the re_perl repo, these scripts were written in 2017 to email new local real estate listings on a daily basis, filtering on specific search criteria. Since the underlying website does not offer any type of email notification, this script was set up as a daily cron job to send links to new listings.

## re_python_data_collection

Using pycurl, this script is run daily via a cron job to retrieve the latest MLS IDs from the real estate website based on some filtering criteria, namely location, price range and property type (house, condo, etc).

After retriving the data, it is stored in a MySQL database table that has some fields for determining whether the property listing is still active and whether it has been emailed using the re_python_mailer (see below).

## re_python_mailer

The mailer script is used to send daily notifications of new real estate listings. It is also run via a cron job, shortly after the previous script. The mail gateway is Sparkpost, which has a free usage tier and a REST API endpoint that can be called using pycurl.

## MySQL schema

```
CREATE TABLE `listings` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `mls_id` varchar(32) DEFAULT NULL,
  `property_type` int(2) DEFAULT NULL,
  `image_url` varchar(256) DEFAULT NULL,
  `address` varchar(256) DEFAULT NULL,
  `price` float(12,2) DEFAULT NULL,
  `email_sent` int(1) DEFAULT NULL,
  `active` int(1) DEFAULT NULL,
  `created` datetime NOT NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=48 DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;
